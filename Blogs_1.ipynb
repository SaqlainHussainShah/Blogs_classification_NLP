However at TJ\\'s I had a small cup of coffee and cream and I just wolfed down a cup of cottage cheese. I dont know how soon the sugar soars after ingestion. time for a med.i either mised my glipizid this morning or taking an extra one for lunch.  okay okay okay. we know that even if I dont eat, if I dont take my meds my sugars are high, is this residual sugars floating aronud? I think the secret to low morning sugar might be the length of time from when I took the last meds, so I will need to talk to the doc about that. I took meds at 6:30 last night., and ate some steak (thats it. meat only, no carbs) at 9:30 or 10 pm. so taking meds now to abate dinner, but I think the problem with morning blood may be the time between meds?  Last night however, i took them rather late, because I ate rather late.  I will not eat dinner for a couple of hours, we\\'ll see what happens in the am. but even if I get up at the crack of dawn, it will have been about 12 hours since meds. good luck to me. ps, I ate another handful of raisens (30 carb) and 7 whole curried eggs (7 carb for eggs 3 for curry), which explains why im not hungry.bleh.  ANYWAY, still way less carbs than normal not too shabby, i am feeling a little lightheaded and trying to gauge when my sugars are low or high.i took one glucophage at 1pm but did not eat. about 90 min ago I had a about 10 raisens (naughty, probably 15 carbs just there) and a bowlful of broccoli and cheese. This eaten at least two hours after taking my meds.  yeah buddie!  Had 4 eggs and chorizo for breakfast, snack was en entire english cuke. sippin on splenda kool-aid right now. no ttoo hungry for lunch.I have not been taking the metabo boosters, I think they were nauseating me so... whats the secret?  last night i took my meds at ten and I had, only 4 eggs con chorizo - 4 carbs. nothing for 10 hours. why is my blood sugar so fucking high?  dammit  also, I feel heavy today. total carbs yesterday less than 60, so what gives.  had an entire english cuke about 4:00 and half a nasty atkins shake just a bit ago. I havent had meds since 1pm and my blood is 114. YES!  time for meds and some flank steak.  big bowl of kale soup - about 20 carbs  half cup cottage cheese - 5 carbs  one glucophage and one glipizid.i\\'m still hungry! not too good. lets see, I took the evening meds at about 5:30, but i ended up eating a big meal at about 9 or 10. I did not eat lunch, but I had an english cucumber with dressing - 6 carbs - when i took the meds, in an hour or two i was starving, so i ate about 34 cup of cottage cheese - 7 carbs, big hunk o\\' mozzarella - 4 carbs and a big bowl of kale soup - 17 carbs.total carbs for the day less than 40, but most of them more than t hours after I took my last meds.conclusion:- meds are fast acting, I should eat right after I take them.- I shouldn\\'t eat after 9pm maybe even earlier.HOWEVER - I haven\\'t eaten a thing in over 8 hours, so really, this is not good.Also, yesterday I woke feeling light and airy. Today I feel heavy. 40 carbs is probably about 500 carbs less than I normally eat in a day AND I took all three glucophage and both glipizid. I really do not want to start shootin up insulin, dammit.  blogging from my skytel pager kicks ASS!!  breakfast, two eggs and several pepperoni slices, a large bottle of tea java. about 3 carbs total. took glucophage and glipizid just before eating. 3 hours later blood sugar at 145. not too shabby, but it should have gone down more.  YES!!!!  135!!!!!  alrighty then.  today  3 eggs, cheese, bacon, avacado, sour cream and tomato omlette - about 10 carbs  half a pria bar - 2 carbs  3 eggs, most of a lo-carb tort, 12 cup beans with cheese about 28 carbs  not bad but i felt nauseous all day five hours later, blood is 190. maybe i should create a blood blog and link it. will figure it all out later.I want to track food, blood sugar, exercise and my thoughts.  I want to RAH RAH SIS BOOM BAH myself.I want this scooter, its a 64\\' model just like me, and green flatters me so:  urlLink scooter loveor this (freakin AWESOME):urlLink  more scooter loveand look at all these yummy ones!  urlLink  scooter woodstocki will treat myself when i reach goal dont feel well. dont know if its the metabo boosters or the glucophage, but i havent felt well all week, upset stomache.  three hours and one glucophage later my bloo is at 202. things are worse than I imagined. the good news is, im watching it. perhaps the glucophage needs to kickin over a period to have me be more responsive, I am going to start taking cinnamon at least 1 tsp a day, per a report i read that some people are usoing that and diet alone to regulate thier sugars. it is obvious that the correct diet (less than 60 carbs a day should be more than sufficient) is not enough for me to combat this.  i know im getting obsessive, but i need to get a handle on this goddamn sugar crisis. crap. full night of fasting plus glucophage and glpizid, and my sugars are still 185. what kinda crap is that? I really should re-read the atkins book before starting. do i want to jump into full on induction phase eating 20 carbs or less a day, or acclimatize myself? I dont know. I think i lived on t-bone steak, cream cheese celery and macadamia nuts the first time.blah 235 one hour after dinner. I had a glucophage this morning and hardly any carbs all day. this is depressing. after fasting my sugar should be at 120 or less, after eating i think at 150.  I should be taking three glucophage a day and two glipizid. its apparent to me that even if I ate nothing, my blood sugar is high, how do you escape that? fuck. I hope if my weight goes down to 150, the diabetes will go away. thats the goal anyway.poop. tommorrow is another day its not working. :( maybe the skytel email isnt fast enough, but what the hell?  my pop just offered me one grand for every ten pounds i lose.i need to lose about 100.thanks dad, i love you shrimp louie salad - 12 carbs can of black olives - 9 carbs protein bar - 3 carbs smart water - 0 carbs big juicy steak - 0 carbs  3 cups zuchinni w little onion - 15 carbs  half a big cucumber - 4 (fiber?)  all in all not bad,plus 2 booster pills with cayanne, greentea leaf etc.I have not officially weighed myself yet, will do that at the gym tommorrow.urlLink me july 4 last year. good pic, doesn\\'t show chins three and four urlLink i am almost 40 going on 14. i weigh in at about 240 my blood sugar is high. close to 200. i am losing my hair (thanks hormones)  last week at my optomitrist, she said if i keep this up, in 8 years i will have retinopathy. not sure what that is exactly, but it dosn\\'t sound good.So, I begin the atkins plan, medication therapy for my hormones and some sort of exercise (sorry hair, you\\'re sol)  and this is the blog.each journey begins with one step woke up at five am,,, realized I hadnt taken my last glucophage last night!!!!! (and I had some carb solutions ice cream at 11pm, bad kitty) so I tested, fearing the worst, and I was at 76!!!... so I took the glucophage and woke up now to 81. SO what is the moral of this story? is the glucophage raising my sugars at night? wtf is going on ?  im so confused.  ham sandwich for lunch, about 1:30. i had some cereal for breakfast, thats it. took glucophage at 2pm.  had stiry fry fresh green beans for dinner, yum, with a hamburger patty.. earlier, around 4pm had about a cup of carb options butter pecan, which was extrodinarily good.. Its now about 2 hours since dinner, and I have not had any meds since lunch.. so my blood sugars leveled off nicely on thier own. took glipizid just now,, will take gluch before bed. ho hum. :) not bad.again, to tired to get up at 4am to take meds. dammit. but, what I did yesterday as take glipizid with dinner.. and 2 hours later I was at 95 which is great.. and then took the glucophage at midnight.  I will try that again tonight.  last night blood was 110, which wasnt bad since I ate late, didnt take meds till 40 min after dinner, and had a huge peice of so-call sugar free candy before going to sleep at about eleven.  I guess it realy is sugar free then. thank god  i finished it and can only buy it fromt he traveling road show at costco.anyhoo.. could not rouse my self to test and take meds at 4:30. so 7:20 blod was 111 and thats not too bad.  Blood has been okay i guess.. 110, 119 afte reating, 99 before aft. snack.  the people on the atkins board seem to think that fasting sugars above 100 are nt acceptable, while the ADA seems to think that up to 120 fasting is okay. so who is right? I dont think there is damage at under 120.. and my levels after eating (within one hour havent been over 140 and within 2 hours have been about 120-126, which is okay. the problem niggling me has been the morning sugars. there is definately something going on. the glucophage i beleive just increases the insulin sensitivity, the glipizid, im not sure, but I beleive it actualy decrease the sugar. So.. im going to do too things, not take my meds until after dinner, about 10 pm, and in the am, take the glipizid at 4:30 and the glucophage before breakfast.so there.i got the blues. okay, trying to outsmart this thing, I set the alarm for 4:30 am, to test and take my morning meds early.I couldnt rouse myslef till five, and I tested (on my arm) at 114. I took only glucophage, thinking both might be too much, and what about breakfast?  went back to sleep and woke up at 9am, and my blood is 121.shit.then i immediately tested my leg, which showed at 130!  so the good news is, I\\'ve been probably testing too high, since leg was my testing site of choice, and  I\\' supposed  to be testing from my fingers or arm.however, i cannot seem to beat this fucking high morning sugar thing.tommorrow I will trytaking just hte glipizid, and next day, both.  but now I have to see if its going to scew up my breakfast reaction. Had about 9 grams carbs with high fiber ceral and cream this morning.  i\\'m having one. although my blood sugars (hereafter known as BS) are pretty close to normal now, and my blood pressure is down as well as my pulse rate, Im pissed at my body. Im pissed that missing my meds even at this low a carb intake, causes major BS spikes, i\\'m not losing any weight and none of these changes has improved my housekeeping skills.bad day, but sugars normal. 30 day avg is 110! this pains me. I had a salad and a nasty atkins banna muffin for dinner, and I ate at about 7pm ish.. definately didnt have any food after 8 and took my meds when I ate dinner.so do I eat before six, do i take my meds late? do i take only the glipizid at dinner... i dont know.it just pisses me off that I am so reducing my  carb intake and still have high morning bloods .  also, I had a dream last night, part of which included me making a take home plate at a party, from a table groaning with many many different kinds of pie.pie.ok and someone mentioned making faux apple pie with jicama. whaddayathink? 14 day avg 105  30 day avg 114  no breakfast (baaaaad kitty) salad and klondike bar for lunch - 8 carbs leftover stirfry for snack - 5 carbs finally! - now I dont know if thats because i had stir fry only for dinner (because I ate late) or if I took my pills so late. i may even have double up, but i usually get a tummy ache when I do, and i feel fine.anyhoo I am not knockin it. yay!  urlLink eBay item 4130354226 (Ends Jul-08-04 17:19:29 PDT) - Lens Kit for 3Com HomeConnect WebCam/Camera  AND i had a klondike fudggickle less than an hour ago (3 carbs total)  im feeling kinda fat tho, i need to gear up for atkins induction to drop some weight..  i am going to test and micromanage a one month menu, before I begin, then it should be easy sailin.  good things :  tiny lamb roasts saute\\'d in olive oil and fresh garlic flap meat marinated in soy and flame grilled klondike lo-carb bars ben and j\\'s no sugar added strawberry pork tacos (soft) with la tortilla factory wheat tillas cukes koolaid  blah. the bad news is, they found a spot on my retina, and now i have to get dilated and checked (my eyeball, not my coochy, get yer mind outta the gutter) for any more abnormalities. good news is if I keep going with my sugars as I am, the problem should be arrested right here.weird news, I decided to take back my new frames (the bifocals) because the reading glass portion wasn\\'t strong enough and i couldn\\'t read my beloved adult swim text from my usual perch on my bed, anymore. it seems that the blood sugar effects the lens thickness of my cornea, and now, 30 days later, my prescription has changed. so they are redoing the lenses. good thing, because the photo gray dip was crap, and they needed to dip again.haven\\'t eaten much today and i need to make dinner for myself and the mijo.  morning blood was 110, current blood is 90 and forgive me, but i will not stop congratulating myself for  doing well with the blood.urlLink oh lord i love this she really irks me, that omarosa no posts ent thru while i was on vaycay, which is wierd, because they showed successful as emails from my bloody pager.blah balh, cheated here and there, blood sugar was okay for the most part. I have to get out of the mind set that i need to be below 100 for regular checks, mom and dad are not, so its cool to be 110 or 108. my 30 day average is below 120, and thats grand.i am going to register a new domain so i can multi blog here, side blog daily blood and carb counts, et al.this will cost about 80 bucks for 2 year domain reg and 1 year hosting (@logjamming.com, yay), so be tuned for a change.my main goal right now is getting this house in order and keeping the blood sugars low. on the horizon, need to pay for west la ticket, ians sleep away camp, and car registration, with ins looming on the horizon. there fore i bought some clothes and make up.

I finally did it, all but the bottom shelf. WHEW!  4 grocery bags stuffed with food, lots of pasta, pancake mix, jello, jello, jello... big part of me is wanting to save it, what a waste.. I think we are taking it the the homeless shelter later...  any way, delete all the crap from the house, so i am not tempted, or ian, when there is nothing \"legal\" to eat.  so far we\\'ve been okay, but i\\'ve been meaning to do this for some time. actually filled two trash cans with stuff that could not be used, opened bags of pasta, old candy, two bags of unsweetened shredded coconut (unopened, but circa last atkins attempt, bag read \"sell before dec 2000\" haahaha)  alrighty then, current blood is 97 actually I didnt wake up until ten, and of course hadnt had meds for 13 hours. i really need to wake up at 5 am, if only to take the meds.reading some atkins bb, i found several interesting diabetes tidbits.  most of them scaring the hell out of me.. i can\\'t keep dwelling on the damage done, can only go forward, ut i hope im not incapacitated in ten years time. dammit.also found out that many many people have the phenom of going to sleep with good sugars and waking up with high sugars. everyone is different, and as I suspected, I am going to have to play with my schedule and diet to get it right..  mom suggested hot tea and cinnamon before going to sleep, i think thats a good idea.i\\'ve been slightly snacking all morning.. heart of palm, .5 carb, 5 so7y flax chips 2.66 carbs, deviled eggs and some chorizo 6 carbs, ben and jerrys no sugar added super fudge CHUNK! 5 carbs.current blood for this aft is 89.  yay. yippidy do dah even tho i was snacking all morning, - two lo carb waffles 11 carbs, two lo carb klondyke bars, 10 carbs. english cuke with dressing 5 carbs, 1.5 chicken spinach fontina sausages 1.5 carbs .... and still 94, which is great.i wonder if there is a time release glucophage for night time, or if i should add some meds i dont know.any hooo.. cant stop munching today. having an avocado with chips - 11 carbs.  i dont know how, but im back on track.yee haw i just dont understand. back to the drawing board nothing since 10:30 am except meds and my blood is 118. what gives??????? this is great. pre lunch blood is 114, down signifcantly in one hour. all in all I think i am doing well.  30 day average 125, still very good. stats say 70-140 is normal.. or considered okay. I want better than normal. based on how I am feeling now, and how i was feeling before, even before I gave birth, this problem had probably been borderline for sometime, also ... many overweight people never get this, or when they do, they are topping the scales over 300... I was never near that, so i have to assume its in my genes. so no blaming.ok. later this isnt bad, less than 40 ,min since i finished a meal at the california culinary acadamy, my young cousins class hosted a luau, i had a breaded shrimp, lobster salad, teriayaki chicken, roast pork, three lamb loin chops and some veggies as well as several bites of various desserts.. probably intook at least 50 carbs.  (but i didnt eat any bread or entire dessert, i maintained).  then I went to starbucks with my mom, blackiced tea with cream - 2 carbs and we got into a spat, blah blah, what else is new? so i will simmmer down, i walked home.  what the hell is going on? im not doing anything different than before! Crap! mom hadn\\'t seen  me for about 4 weeks, and she said she could see a differnce in my appearance immediately. i think its just the water.. i carry about 20 lbs in water retention... but still.. its something. had some hearts of palm - 2 carbs and bag of no carb citrus slices (66 sugar alcohol. one hour later my blood was 135!!! apparently they DO effect my blood sugar.had 2.5 fried tacos on mission whole wheat lo-carb tortillas - 10 carbs and some clavasita (zucchini with onion tomato and cheese) 8 carbs. good dinner.took my meds at 7pm, was still snacking a bit on veggies at 8pm, my blood sugar is now 116. it\\'s not been a banner day here.  i feel headachey, fat, bloated and generaly disgruntled, blood was 104 just now and 110 2 hours ago, havent eaten since 10:30 am, i should be lower!!!  while this isn\\'t horrible, i wish it were lower. espcially since i\\'ve been hungry since breakfast.. i think it was really just the cheesy bread, so savory, made me want to eat something good.well i\\'m not going to fight it, but I\\'m going to have a salad. 6 carbs.avocado, cuke, cheese, lettuce, cilantro, pepperoni lo-carb waffle - 5.5 lo-carb orowheat 1 slice - 6 carbs 2 eggs and cheese - 3 carbs  total 14.5  by the way, orowheat breat, liberally applied with clearman\\'s cheese spread (no carbs) is a DELIGHT.yeesh. i had ben and jerrys 12 cup no sugar added deliciousness last night at 9pm, right after i took my meds... but i still don\\'t understand the chemistry of all this.ben and jerrys no sugar added super fudge chunk, 18 carbs per half cup minus 5 carbs fiber minus 8 carbs sugar alchohol. 5 cabrs per serving!!!! yippee!!!! okay.. i need to try the lo carb heaven one now..  had dinner about 8,  pork stir fry and a lo-carb dessert - total carbs 9, had several eggs about 4 - 5 carbs didnt take my meds till just now. after dinner blood is 110, whis is great i havent eaten since this morning or taken meds.had half a STRIVE bar (very very good, but about 33 sugar alchohol type carbs, doesnt seem to have effected my blood sugars at all. Had one lo-carb waffle and 4 eggs for breakfast (deviled) 9.5 carbs. half a strive bar and iced tea with cream 4.5 carbs. im not really hungry tho. but i should eat. i beleive consistant eating schedule is key to the sugars. but quien sabes que? morning blood 107 poop i had a large salad and a locarb klondyke bar 13 carbs total? after 8pm took meds at i, actually had the icecream at 10pm live and \\'earn. i feel heavy  cruisin\\' plans for this blog -multi blog includes to track carbs and blood.  blog link strictly for lo-carb food reviews.  blog link to picture tracking.new color scheme  - toying with a tree green or a sunny orange on white. maybe some sort of include, for the multi mini blogs on the side.i need help! and or a long weekend  I am pretty fucking excited tho, because so far this experience has been very calm... none of the desperation of a diet, even the first one, considering the impetus was going blind in the not to distant future. it suprisingly easy. but i am not pushing hard on the weight loss, i\\'m pushing hard on the sugar control. both ian and i have been eating lots more veggies, but i should look into multi vitamins as i heard that the high protien diet leaches calcium.ian is not on atkins, but really just cut out most breads and definately pastas. he is having a sandwhich at lunch for school, but that is the most grains he gets. i will look into lo carb pastas, but i want him to get into the habit of complex carbs, such as beans and whole grains. when we went to p.f. changs (who by the way, has a whole side menu listing nutritional content) he ate about one quarter of the rice he was served. i was proud.  as a society in general we shovel gobs and gobs of crap in our mouths daily and think nothing of it. now that i\\'m eating right, i am feeling so much better, due entirely to my sugar levels regulating, but it feel somewhat like a miracle and i don\\'t know why it took this long to reach this space. i fear i have done minor damage that will rear its ugly head in 10 years and slam me to the ground.all that means is live now. because i cant stop that, i can only fix where i am. my body is so forgiving to me tho (10 years of abuse, and 2 weeks im almost back to normal again) that i have high hopes of self regeneration.getting to the gym has not yet happened. I MUST DO THIS.  some one light a fire under my ass please.  extreme nausea. i feel pukey. was it that turkey bacon thingy? my ketones? I dont have rank breath so i dont think im ketone-y (too bad since that equals fat burning) but urgh. blood is 86. again, very good blood stats today! meds and a large salad with lettucetomatoavacadocelerypepperonicuke and this little turkey mignon medallion thingy - about 7 carbs total.  wishbone carb solutions olive oil vinagrette is da bomb people.i don\\'t like waiting and i don\\'t like when my  customers make me wait for no good reason. i scheduled this service at his convenience and somehow hes in conference when i arrive, can some one else show me to the pc i need to fix? noooooooo i must wait. fuk em at 65 an hour, i\\'ll wait. the great news is my blood one hour after breakfast was 96. that rocks, i mean really rocks.wow. funny thing is, I dont feel light, i feel kinda bloated and i\\'ve had muscle soreness getting worse and worse by the day, my shoulder is really killing me. poo  breakfast - lo carb waffle and 2eggs with cheese arb count 8.5  TA carne asada and a big salad. hansens kiwi strawberry soda (diet of course) 10 carbs later (about 90 min) my blood is 108. not bad.  Is very good. or rather a very good compromise. For anyone who has ever been to the northwoods in, or the boat, you\\'ll know how delicious thier cheesy bread is. spread generously over orowheat and broil. DELICIOUS and only 6 carbs per serving.total carbs today so far, less than 30 all the toppings of a costco combo pizza slice and half a polish sausage with mustard.. also one lo-carb klondyke bar (only 5 carbs and a little bit of heaven) sooooo.... took my lunchtime meds at about 1:30, ate at about 3:30,  total carbs, I\\'m going to give it a 12.ok ok i know it\\'s obsessive, but i checked my blood again when i finishd my service call, 82, so its gone down 17 points in one hour. brave new world.  i feel light headed and shakey, sounds arelike i\\'m ina awell, felt  like this before i fainted(the one and only time) so i pulled over to check my sugars and i\\'m at 99? wierd  waffle at 7:45 - then i had to dash, i\\'m going to make a salad now, don\\'t know if i will have time for lunch.ps. except for dawson, dawson\\'s creek still totally rocks my world.also, lets hear it for giant salads - entire avacado, and various veggies - probably 10 carbs max looking good, looking good.  and there is a way to incorporate more than one blog, it will just take some work. alot of work. I really need to think about getting a new domain and host. i have a full freaking day of work ahead of me, so  blah it\\'s a monday. but i havent had my salad yet. maybe I\\'ll just go to sleep just ate - lamb chops and salad with cheese, tomato, cuke, cilantro and pepperoni yum. probably about 5 carbs. Had a klondyke lo-carb bar after getting that 64 reading.. it only has three net carbs, but alot of these sweet treats have sugar alchohols, great for the diabetes, but no stored fat will burn until the sugar alcohols do. still, I am feeling well in general and on the right track.my shoulder has really been bothering me and I need to start therapy for this - apparently frozen shoulder is a symptom of diabetes. and it hurts.took my meds and I\\'m going in for another salad.night okay. thats too low. time to eat.  breakfast was late, 2 eggs, some corned beef hash and two lo carb waffles. 13 carbs total. lunch - an avacado with 8 flax seed tortilla chips - 10 carbs total. Oooh and some yummy grape k00l-aid.  yup I know this blog is boring, but its meant as a tracking diary, not track side entertainment, HOWEVER - I would like to revamp it a bit to somehow include - food diary, blood tracker, weight tracker.  what I dont want is to have to update the template every time. but it would be nice to view it simply, on a side table - such as daily blood, daily carbs, weekly weight. I love the simplicity of blogger and the fact that I can post from my pager, you must admit, is wicked cool.I also need to take some mofugly pictures of me in a \\'tard and tights or something, and update that weekly - eventually compile them into one animated gif - \"the amazingly fine shrinking kitty\"  mom and pop are proud of my progress (which really should have begun 10 years ago - but ni modo) and that makes me feel fine. im such a needy kitty, requiring validation at every turn. this is why I would make a splendid rock star. Vh1 presents, \"behind the kitty\" HAH  14 day average 135 - looking good.  about one hour nad a half after ingesting at least 20 carbs, 11 of which were grains, my blood is 112, excellent as mr. burns would say, excellent well.. got my butt out of bed and had some celery and spinach dip 3 carbs, a whole avacado 6 carbs and 2 low carb waffles 11 carbs  total today, about 24 carbs. i feel okay tho, not fainty. this morning it was 125, but i ate late.. and I didnt take any meds until 9am.. @ noon, it was 96. I had 3 deviled half eggs, a handful of almonds and prettymuch forced myself into a map/ its 3:15 and I pretty, much havent eaten anything today. also.. if my moms scale is correct, i lost 9 pounds.  beej wants to go to the movies, but we\\'ve already seen potter. what else is there?? aft blood 89!!!!  forgot to bring my pill box tho. 2 eggs and a whole avacado for breakfast 8 carbs and nothing since  hell yes again!  dont feel too bloaty. but woke up in the middle of the night with horrendous cramps at 330 today my blood was 99 and I had 2 protien burgers - 22 carb-os  taking my meds now, and going to eat in about 30 min, i shouldnt eat this late, i will be bloaty and stuff in the morning, and tho it will be lo carb and my total daily carbs should be under 60..  having a caca day, cant seem to get off the friggin phone, one thing after another and i am going to miss the hollywood calls  at 7:45 I ate a waffle - 5.5 carbs - and took my meds. about an hour later i\\'m at 126 - i think thats pretty good HELL YES!  :) took my meds about 9:30 last night.. but didnt eat after (ate before - steak and broccoli)  had a TJ waffle for breakfast. so tasty, i cant believe its only 5.5 carbs. aft blood 110finally, somewhat normal, but i haven\\'t eaten since 11 AMfour eggs con chorizo 4 carbs.  one lo-carb waffle 5.5 carbs, one cup lo-carb milk 3 carbs  this is ridiculous. I had one low carb Trader Joes bluberry waffle - 5 carbs (supposedly) and two meds. so what gives!  plus im hungry.plus im hungry.  plus im hungry. caca. one day of cheating, a little cheating mind you.... I probably had about 150-200 carbs yesterday and I took all my meds. when I think of how  i was eating just until a week ago.. i shudder.. i would take in, hmm.... 400-600 a day easy i\\'m sure. and on days when i had a sweet tooth. argh.i feel like im going to explode. i can\\'t worry about whats done, its done. but tis scary to think of the future. ever vigilant.if i can lose the weight, at least 50 pounds, then i beleive my sugars will react better. hopefully the glucophage therapy will beat my ovaries into submission and assist. but menopause approaches and its going to be a downhill battle.not a good morning.plus, someone bought my company. I\\'ll get the scoop at the 8am conference call. at least its LA based, not dallas, perhaps they will be more sensative to our gas plight and jack up the milage.  4 hours later my blood sugar is 146 which is not good dammit. never again  day 8 and i cheated. and it was bad food! i ordered stroganoff, lite noodles, but it was more like congealed beef stew over noodles? i only had a few egg noodels, like less than 1/4 cup, but the meat tasted real flour-y and i had a small slice of banana bread. 50-80 carbs for this bullshit meal, and i will probably get tummy cramps to boot. live and learn, should sprang for the t-bone!!  11 AM and i havent eaten anything, nor did i take my meds, blood sugar is 165 this means meds are key, food, not so much. going to take meds and eat a big lunch now. ta!  rock on. took meds 14 hours ago, but did not eat after about 7:3 0or so. woke up feeling very light.urlLink Palm Store - Factory Outlet: palmOneï¿½ Tungstenï¿½ T3 Open Box Handheld  this is the one for me, 110$ discount for open box plus, join palm book club and get another 100 bucks off (but pay 10-15 bucks a month for one year) which is kinda like credit.... plus I get a free book once a month. so total out of pocket is 188$ for a kick ass palm, plus hardcase and 2 cradles.i need 500$ for the phone and the palm. and I need it quick.urlLink Sanyo - Dual-Band Tri-Mode PCS Cell Phone w/Camera (Sprint) - Blue - PM8200KITU  i think i\\'m going to go with this one, I\\'ll go to best buy and see.but I also need to pay off the last ticket, pay off Ian\\'s camping trip, and get myself to the bodyartexpo where I might like to spend a little money dammit.urlLink this is the baby I wantbut its a shell out of 279 plus tax which I can ill afford and weight 2 months for the 150 back. well of course the blogging honeymoon is over.also I need to get a new domain, got paid today, will do this weekend. create several blog in blogs, with carb and blood counters. yahoootie!  been up and down and losing no weight with this puppy, really just trying to keep blood down. I feel its a good investment, because I will be living like this when I lose the weight. my only concern is the low carb mania. when it ends, will ben and jerry\\'s still have low carb ice cream? miltons low carb bread? hay yi yi. I hope so, or life will be dismal indeed. diet cherry coke will save this summer for me. I feel a little  tingly and week. didnt have dinner until about ten last night. stirfry, veggies and chicken and diet soda and a glipizid. I hadnt had any meds since noon and i think my blood was high before dinner because at midnight it was 121. not horrible but would rather it was down to under 100. oh well.. im still in a good place. viva la raza! big oops to that. chicken soup and kale soup last night, but i also had a peach and some rasberries with a little cream and cereal. boo hoo.  and im still sick, now the infection is in my chest.  aft breakfast blood 80!!! all hale the kale soup. life saving  I think I am going to go for it. this palm has built in camera (1.2 megapixel) and bluetooth and an expansion slot. so i am excited, I have been eyballing this one for a while.okay wait. poopy, its a 71, discontinued, processor less than half the speed of the 72. fuggit. the 72 is 299... im just going to wait for an open box for it. oh blah.  okay, but im wierded out.  i waited to take my meds until midnight last night, but I fell asleep before taking them. so what gives? but the times I purposfully didnt take them thinking, something is wierd about this.. my sugars shot up?

However at TJ\\'s I had a small cup of coffee and cream and I just wolfed down a cup of cottage cheese. I dont know how soon the sugar soars after ingestion. time for a med.i either mised my glipizid this morning or taking an extra one for lunch.  okay okay okay. we know that even if I dont eat, if I dont take my meds my sugars are high, is this residual sugars floating aronud? I think the secret to low morning sugar might be the length of time from when I took the last meds, so I will need to talk to the doc about that. I took meds at 6:30 last night., and ate some steak (thats it. meat only, no carbs) at 9:30 or 10 pm. so taking meds now to abate dinner, but I think the problem with morning blood may be the time between meds?  Last night however, i took them rather late, because I ate rather late.  I will not eat dinner for a couple of hours, we\\'ll see what happens in the am. but even if I get up at the crack of dawn, it will have been about 12 hours since meds. good luck to me. ps, I ate another handful of raisens (30 carb) and 7 whole curried eggs (7 carb for eggs 3 for curry), which explains why im not hungry.bleh.  ANYWAY, still way less carbs than normal not too shabby, i am feeling a little lightheaded and trying to gauge when my sugars are low or high.i took one glucophage at 1pm but did not eat. about 90 min ago I had a about 10 raisens (naughty, probably 15 carbs just there) and a bowlful of broccoli and cheese. This eaten at least two hours after taking my meds.  yeah buddie!  Had 4 eggs and chorizo for breakfast, snack was en entire english cuke. sippin on splenda kool-aid right now. no ttoo hungry for lunch.I have not been taking the metabo boosters, I think they were nauseating me so... whats the secret?  last night i took my meds at ten and I had, only 4 eggs con chorizo - 4 carbs. nothing for 10 hours. why is my blood sugar so fucking high?  dammit  also, I feel heavy today. total carbs yesterday less than 60, so what gives.  had an entire english cuke about 4:00 and half a nasty atkins shake just a bit ago. I havent had meds since 1pm and my blood is 114. YES!  time for meds and some flank steak.  big bowl of kale soup - about 20 carbs  half cup cottage cheese - 5 carbs  one glucophage and one glipizid.i\\'m still hungry! not too good. lets see, I took the evening meds at about 5:30, but i ended up eating a big meal at about 9 or 10. I did not eat lunch, but I had an english cucumber with dressing - 6 carbs - when i took the meds, in an hour or two i was starving, so i ate about 34 cup of cottage cheese - 7 carbs, big hunk o\\' mozzarella - 4 carbs and a big bowl of kale soup - 17 carbs.total carbs for the day less than 40, but most of them more than t hours after I took my last meds.conclusion:- meds are fast acting, I should eat right after I take them.- I shouldn\\'t eat after 9pm maybe even earlier.HOWEVER - I haven\\'t eaten a thing in over 8 hours, so really, this is not good.Also, yesterday I woke feeling light and airy. Today I feel heavy. 40 carbs is probably about 500 carbs less than I normally eat in a day AND I took all three glucophage and both glipizid. I really do not want to start shootin up insulin, dammit.  blogging from my skytel pager kicks ASS!!  breakfast, two eggs and several pepperoni slices, a large bottle of tea java. about 3 carbs total. took glucophage and glipizid just before eating. 3 hours later blood sugar at 145. not too shabby, but it should have gone down more.  YES!!!!  135!!!!!  alrighty then.  today  3 eggs, cheese, bacon, avacado, sour cream and tomato omlette - about 10 carbs  half a pria bar - 2 carbs  3 eggs, most of a lo-carb tort, 12 cup beans with cheese about 28 carbs  not bad but i felt nauseous all day five hours later, blood is 190. maybe i should create a blood blog and link it. will figure it all out later.I want to track food, blood sugar, exercise and my thoughts.  I want to RAH RAH SIS BOOM BAH myself.I want this scooter, its a 64\\' model just like me, and green flatters me so:  urlLink scooter loveor this (freakin AWESOME):urlLink  more scooter loveand look at all these yummy ones!  urlLink  scooter woodstocki will treat myself when i reach goal dont feel well. dont know if its the metabo boosters or the glucophage, but i havent felt well all week, upset stomache.  three hours and one glucophage later my bloo is at 202. things are worse than I imagined. the good news is, im watching it. perhaps the glucophage needs to kickin over a period to have me be more responsive, I am going to start taking cinnamon at least 1 tsp a day, per a report i read that some people are usoing that and diet alone to regulate thier sugars. it is obvious that the correct diet (less than 60 carbs a day should be more than sufficient) is not enough for me to combat this.  i know im getting obsessive, but i need to get a handle on this goddamn sugar crisis. crap. full night of fasting plus glucophage and glpizid, and my sugars are still 185. what kinda crap is that? I really should re-read the atkins book before starting. do i want to jump into full on induction phase eating 20 carbs or less a day, or acclimatize myself? I dont know. I think i lived on t-bone steak, cream cheese celery and macadamia nuts the first time.blah 235 one hour after dinner. I had a glucophage this morning and hardly any carbs all day. this is depressing. after fasting my sugar should be at 120 or less, after eating i think at 150.  I should be taking three glucophage a day and two glipizid. its apparent to me that even if I ate nothing, my blood sugar is high, how do you escape that? fuck. I hope if my weight goes down to 150, the diabetes will go away. thats the goal anyway.poop. tommorrow is another day its not working. :( maybe the skytel email isnt fast enough, but what the hell?  my pop just offered me one grand for every ten pounds i lose.i need to lose about 100.thanks dad, i love you shrimp louie salad - 12 carbs can of black olives - 9 carbs protein bar - 3 carbs smart water - 0 carbs big juicy steak - 0 carbs  3 cups zuchinni w little onion - 15 carbs  half a big cucumber - 4 (fiber?)  all in all not bad,plus 2 booster pills with cayanne, greentea leaf etc.I have not officially weighed myself yet, will do that at the gym tommorrow.urlLink me july 4 last year. good pic, doesn\\'t show chins three and four urlLink i am almost 40 going on 14. i weigh in at about 240 my blood sugar is high. close to 200. i am losing my hair (thanks hormones)  last week at my optomitrist, she said if i keep this up, in 8 years i will have retinopathy. not sure what that is exactly, but it dosn\\'t sound good.So, I begin the atkins plan, medication therapy for my hormones and some sort of exercise (sorry hair, you\\'re sol)  and this is the blog.each journey begins with one step woke up at five am,,, realized I hadnt taken my last glucophage last night!!!!! (and I had some carb solutions ice cream at 11pm, bad kitty) so I tested, fearing the worst, and I was at 76!!!... so I took the glucophage and woke up now to 81. SO what is the moral of this story? is the glucophage raising my sugars at night? wtf is going on ?  im so confused.  ham sandwich for lunch, about 1:30. i had some cereal for breakfast, thats it. took glucophage at 2pm.  had stiry fry fresh green beans for dinner, yum, with a hamburger patty.. earlier, around 4pm had about a cup of carb options butter pecan, which was extrodinarily good.. Its now about 2 hours since dinner, and I have not had any meds since lunch.. so my blood sugars leveled off nicely on thier own. took glipizid just now,, will take gluch before bed. ho hum. :) not bad.again, to tired to get up at 4am to take meds. dammit. but, what I did yesterday as take glipizid with dinner.. and 2 hours later I was at 95 which is great.. and then took the glucophage at midnight.  I will try that again tonight.  last night blood was 110, which wasnt bad since I ate late, didnt take meds till 40 min after dinner, and had a huge peice of so-call sugar free candy before going to sleep at about eleven.  I guess it realy is sugar free then. thank god  i finished it and can only buy it fromt he traveling road show at costco.anyhoo.. could not rouse my self to test and take meds at 4:30. so 7:20 blod was 111 and thats not too bad.  Blood has been okay i guess.. 110, 119 afte reating, 99 before aft. snack.  the people on the atkins board seem to think that fasting sugars above 100 are nt acceptable, while the ADA seems to think that up to 120 fasting is okay. so who is right? I dont think there is damage at under 120.. and my levels after eating (within one hour havent been over 140 and within 2 hours have been about 120-126, which is okay. the problem niggling me has been the morning sugars. there is definately something going on. the glucophage i beleive just increases the insulin sensitivity, the glipizid, im not sure, but I beleive it actualy decrease the sugar. So.. im going to do too things, not take my meds until after dinner, about 10 pm, and in the am, take the glipizid at 4:30 and the glucophage before breakfast.so there.i got the blues. okay, trying to outsmart this thing, I set the alarm for 4:30 am, to test and take my morning meds early.I couldnt rouse myslef till five, and I tested (on my arm) at 114. I took only glucophage, thinking both might be too much, and what about breakfast?  went back to sleep and woke up at 9am, and my blood is 121.shit.then i immediately tested my leg, which showed at 130!  so the good news is, I\\'ve been probably testing too high, since leg was my testing site of choice, and  I\\' supposed  to be testing from my fingers or arm.however, i cannot seem to beat this fucking high morning sugar thing.tommorrow I will trytaking just hte glipizid, and next day, both.  but now I have to see if its going to scew up my breakfast reaction. Had about 9 grams carbs with high fiber ceral and cream this morning.  i\\'m having one. although my blood sugars (hereafter known as BS) are pretty close to normal now, and my blood pressure is down as well as my pulse rate, Im pissed at my body. Im pissed that missing my meds even at this low a carb intake, causes major BS spikes, i\\'m not losing any weight and none of these changes has improved my housekeeping skills.bad day, but sugars normal. 30 day avg is 110! this pains me. I had a salad and a nasty atkins banna muffin for dinner, and I ate at about 7pm ish.. definately didnt have any food after 8 and took my meds when I ate dinner.so do I eat before six, do i take my meds late? do i take only the glipizid at dinner... i dont know.it just pisses me off that I am so reducing my  carb intake and still have high morning bloods .  also, I had a dream last night, part of which included me making a take home plate at a party, from a table groaning with many many different kinds of pie.pie.ok and someone mentioned making faux apple pie with jicama. whaddayathink? 14 day avg 105  30 day avg 114  no breakfast (baaaaad kitty) salad and klondike bar for lunch - 8 carbs leftover stirfry for snack - 5 carbs finally! - now I dont know if thats because i had stir fry only for dinner (because I ate late) or if I took my pills so late. i may even have double up, but i usually get a tummy ache when I do, and i feel fine.anyhoo I am not knockin it. yay!  urlLink eBay item 4130354226 (Ends Jul-08-04 17:19:29 PDT) - Lens Kit for 3Com HomeConnect WebCam/Camera  AND i had a klondike fudggickle less than an hour ago (3 carbs total)  im feeling kinda fat tho, i need to gear up for atkins induction to drop some weight..  i am going to test and micromanage a one month menu, before I begin, then it should be easy sailin.  good things :  tiny lamb roasts saute\\'d in olive oil and fresh garlic flap meat marinated in soy and flame grilled klondike lo-carb bars ben and j\\'s no sugar added strawberry pork tacos (soft) with la tortilla factory wheat tillas cukes koolaid  blah. the bad news is, they found a spot on my retina, and now i have to get dilated and checked (my eyeball, not my coochy, get yer mind outta the gutter) for any more abnormalities. good news is if I keep going with my sugars as I am, the problem should be arrested right here.weird news, I decided to take back my new frames (the bifocals) because the reading glass portion wasn\\'t strong enough and i couldn\\'t read my beloved adult swim text from my usual perch on my bed, anymore. it seems that the blood sugar effects the lens thickness of my cornea, and now, 30 days later, my prescription has changed. so they are redoing the lenses. good thing, because the photo gray dip was crap, and they needed to dip again.haven\\'t eaten much today and i need to make dinner for myself and the mijo.  morning blood was 110, current blood is 90 and forgive me, but i will not stop congratulating myself for  doing well with the blood.urlLink oh lord i love this she really irks me, that omarosa no posts ent thru while i was on vaycay, which is wierd, because they showed successful as emails from my bloody pager.blah balh, cheated here and there, blood sugar was okay for the most part. I have to get out of the mind set that i need to be below 100 for regular checks, mom and dad are not, so its cool to be 110 or 108. my 30 day average is below 120, and thats grand.i am going to register a new domain so i can multi blog here, side blog daily blood and carb counts, et al.this will cost about 80 bucks for 2 year domain reg and 1 year hosting (@logjamming.com, yay), so be tuned for a change.my main goal right now is getting this house in order and keeping the blood sugars low. on the horizon, need to pay for west la ticket, ians sleep away camp, and car registration, with ins looming on the horizon. there fore i bought some clothes and make up.

I finally did it, all but the bottom shelf. WHEW!  4 grocery bags stuffed with food, lots of pasta, pancake mix, jello, jello, jello... big part of me is wanting to save it, what a waste.. I think we are taking it the the homeless shelter later...  any way, delete all the crap from the house, so i am not tempted, or ian, when there is nothing \"legal\" to eat.  so far we\\'ve been okay, but i\\'ve been meaning to do this for some time. actually filled two trash cans with stuff that could not be used, opened bags of pasta, old candy, two bags of unsweetened shredded coconut (unopened, but circa last atkins attempt, bag read \"sell before dec 2000\" haahaha)  alrighty then, current blood is 97 actually I didnt wake up until ten, and of course hadnt had meds for 13 hours. i really need to wake up at 5 am, if only to take the meds.reading some atkins bb, i found several interesting diabetes tidbits.  most of them scaring the hell out of me.. i can\\'t keep dwelling on the damage done, can only go forward, ut i hope im not incapacitated in ten years time. dammit.also found out that many many people have the phenom of going to sleep with good sugars and waking up with high sugars. everyone is different, and as I suspected, I am going to have to play with my schedule and diet to get it right..  mom suggested hot tea and cinnamon before going to sleep, i think thats a good idea.i\\'ve been slightly snacking all morning.. heart of palm, .5 carb, 5 so7y flax chips 2.66 carbs, deviled eggs and some chorizo 6 carbs, ben and jerrys no sugar added super fudge CHUNK! 5 carbs.current blood for this aft is 89.  yay. yippidy do dah even tho i was snacking all morning, - two lo carb waffles 11 carbs, two lo carb klondyke bars, 10 carbs. english cuke with dressing 5 carbs, 1.5 chicken spinach fontina sausages 1.5 carbs .... and still 94, which is great.i wonder if there is a time release glucophage for night time, or if i should add some meds i dont know.any hooo.. cant stop munching today. having an avocado with chips - 11 carbs.  i dont know how, but im back on track.yee haw i just dont understand. back to the drawing board nothing since 10:30 am except meds and my blood is 118. what gives??????? this is great. pre lunch blood is 114, down signifcantly in one hour. all in all I think i am doing well.  30 day average 125, still very good. stats say 70-140 is normal.. or considered okay. I want better than normal. based on how I am feeling now, and how i was feeling before, even before I gave birth, this problem had probably been borderline for sometime, also ... many overweight people never get this, or when they do, they are topping the scales over 300... I was never near that, so i have to assume its in my genes. so no blaming.ok. later this isnt bad, less than 40 ,min since i finished a meal at the california culinary acadamy, my young cousins class hosted a luau, i had a breaded shrimp, lobster salad, teriayaki chicken, roast pork, three lamb loin chops and some veggies as well as several bites of various desserts.. probably intook at least 50 carbs.  (but i didnt eat any bread or entire dessert, i maintained).  then I went to starbucks with my mom, blackiced tea with cream - 2 carbs and we got into a spat, blah blah, what else is new? so i will simmmer down, i walked home.  what the hell is going on? im not doing anything different than before! Crap! mom hadn\\'t seen  me for about 4 weeks, and she said she could see a differnce in my appearance immediately. i think its just the water.. i carry about 20 lbs in water retention... but still.. its something. had some hearts of palm - 2 carbs and bag of no carb citrus slices (66 sugar alcohol. one hour later my blood was 135!!! apparently they DO effect my blood sugar.had 2.5 fried tacos on mission whole wheat lo-carb tortillas - 10 carbs and some clavasita (zucchini with onion tomato and cheese) 8 carbs. good dinner.took my meds at 7pm, was still snacking a bit on veggies at 8pm, my blood sugar is now 116. it\\'s not been a banner day here.  i feel headachey, fat, bloated and generaly disgruntled, blood was 104 just now and 110 2 hours ago, havent eaten since 10:30 am, i should be lower!!!  while this isn\\'t horrible, i wish it were lower. espcially since i\\'ve been hungry since breakfast.. i think it was really just the cheesy bread, so savory, made me want to eat something good.well i\\'m not going to fight it, but I\\'m going to have a salad. 6 carbs.avocado, cuke, cheese, lettuce, cilantro, pepperoni lo-carb waffle - 5.5 lo-carb orowheat 1 slice - 6 carbs 2 eggs and cheese - 3 carbs  total 14.5  by the way, orowheat breat, liberally applied with clearman\\'s cheese spread (no carbs) is a DELIGHT.yeesh. i had ben and jerrys 12 cup no sugar added deliciousness last night at 9pm, right after i took my meds... but i still don\\'t understand the chemistry of all this.ben and jerrys no sugar added super fudge chunk, 18 carbs per half cup minus 5 carbs fiber minus 8 carbs sugar alchohol. 5 cabrs per serving!!!! yippee!!!! okay.. i need to try the lo carb heaven one now..  had dinner about 8,  pork stir fry and a lo-carb dessert - total carbs 9, had several eggs about 4 - 5 carbs didnt take my meds till just now. after dinner blood is 110, whis is great i havent eaten since this morning or taken meds.had half a STRIVE bar (very very good, but about 33 sugar alchohol type carbs, doesnt seem to have effected my blood sugars at all. Had one lo-carb waffle and 4 eggs for breakfast (deviled) 9.5 carbs. half a strive bar and iced tea with cream 4.5 carbs. im not really hungry tho. but i should eat. i beleive consistant eating schedule is key to the sugars. but quien sabes que? morning blood 107 poop i had a large salad and a locarb klondyke bar 13 carbs total? after 8pm took meds at i, actually had the icecream at 10pm live and \\'earn. i feel heavy  cruisin\\' plans for this blog -multi blog includes to track carbs and blood.  blog link strictly for lo-carb food reviews.  blog link to picture tracking.new color scheme  - toying with a tree green or a sunny orange on white. maybe some sort of include, for the multi mini blogs on the side.i need help! and or a long weekend  I am pretty fucking excited tho, because so far this experience has been very calm... none of the desperation of a diet, even the first one, considering the impetus was going blind in the not to distant future. it suprisingly easy. but i am not pushing hard on the weight loss, i\\'m pushing hard on the sugar control. both ian and i have been eating lots more veggies, but i should look into multi vitamins as i heard that the high protien diet leaches calcium.ian is not on atkins, but really just cut out most breads and definately pastas. he is having a sandwhich at lunch for school, but that is the most grains he gets. i will look into lo carb pastas, but i want him to get into the habit of complex carbs, such as beans and whole grains. when we went to p.f. changs (who by the way, has a whole side menu listing nutritional content) he ate about one quarter of the rice he was served. i was proud.  as a society in general we shovel gobs and gobs of crap in our mouths daily and think nothing of it. now that i\\'m eating right, i am feeling so much better, due entirely to my sugar levels regulating, but it feel somewhat like a miracle and i don\\'t know why it took this long to reach this space. i fear i have done minor damage that will rear its ugly head in 10 years and slam me to the ground.all that means is live now. because i cant stop that, i can only fix where i am. my body is so forgiving to me tho (10 years of abuse, and 2 weeks im almost back to normal again) that i have high hopes of self regeneration.getting to the gym has not yet happened. I MUST DO THIS.  some one light a fire under my ass please.  extreme nausea. i feel pukey. was it that turkey bacon thingy? my ketones? I dont have rank breath so i dont think im ketone-y (too bad since that equals fat burning) but urgh. blood is 86. again, very good blood stats today! meds and a large salad with lettucetomatoavacadocelerypepperonicuke and this little turkey mignon medallion thingy - about 7 carbs total.  wishbone carb solutions olive oil vinagrette is da bomb people.i don\\'t like waiting and i don\\'t like when my  customers make me wait for no good reason. i scheduled this service at his convenience and somehow hes in conference when i arrive, can some one else show me to the pc i need to fix? noooooooo i must wait. fuk em at 65 an hour, i\\'ll wait. the great news is my blood one hour after breakfast was 96. that rocks, i mean really rocks.wow. funny thing is, I dont feel light, i feel kinda bloated and i\\'ve had muscle soreness getting worse and worse by the day, my shoulder is really killing me. poo  breakfast - lo carb waffle and 2eggs with cheese arb count 8.5  TA carne asada and a big salad. hansens kiwi strawberry soda (diet of course) 10 carbs later (about 90 min) my blood is 108. not bad.  Is very good. or rather a very good compromise. For anyone who has ever been to the northwoods in, or the boat, you\\'ll know how delicious thier cheesy bread is. spread generously over orowheat and broil. DELICIOUS and only 6 carbs per serving.total carbs today so far, less than 30 all the toppings of a costco combo pizza slice and half a polish sausage with mustard.. also one lo-carb klondyke bar (only 5 carbs and a little bit of heaven) sooooo.... took my lunchtime meds at about 1:30, ate at about 3:30,  total carbs, I\\'m going to give it a 12.ok ok i know it\\'s obsessive, but i checked my blood again when i finishd my service call, 82, so its gone down 17 points in one hour. brave new world.  i feel light headed and shakey, sounds arelike i\\'m ina awell, felt  like this before i fainted(the one and only time) so i pulled over to check my sugars and i\\'m at 99? wierd  waffle at 7:45 - then i had to dash, i\\'m going to make a salad now, don\\'t know if i will have time for lunch.ps. except for dawson, dawson\\'s creek still totally rocks my world.also, lets hear it for giant salads - entire avacado, and various veggies - probably 10 carbs max looking good, looking good.  and there is a way to incorporate more than one blog, it will just take some work. alot of work. I really need to think about getting a new domain and host. i have a full freaking day of work ahead of me, so  blah it\\'s a monday. but i havent had my salad yet. maybe I\\'ll just go to sleep just ate - lamb chops and salad with cheese, tomato, cuke, cilantro and pepperoni yum. probably about 5 carbs. Had a klondyke lo-carb bar after getting that 64 reading.. it only has three net carbs, but alot of these sweet treats have sugar alchohols, great for the diabetes, but no stored fat will burn until the sugar alcohols do. still, I am feeling well in general and on the right track.my shoulder has really been bothering me and I need to start therapy for this - apparently frozen shoulder is a symptom of diabetes. and it hurts.took my meds and I\\'m going in for another salad.night okay. thats too low. time to eat.  breakfast was late, 2 eggs, some corned beef hash and two lo carb waffles. 13 carbs total. lunch - an avacado with 8 flax seed tortilla chips - 10 carbs total. Oooh and some yummy grape k00l-aid.  yup I know this blog is boring, but its meant as a tracking diary, not track side entertainment, HOWEVER - I would like to revamp it a bit to somehow include - food diary, blood tracker, weight tracker.  what I dont want is to have to update the template every time. but it would be nice to view it simply, on a side table - such as daily blood, daily carbs, weekly weight. I love the simplicity of blogger and the fact that I can post from my pager, you must admit, is wicked cool.I also need to take some mofugly pictures of me in a \\'tard and tights or something, and update that weekly - eventually compile them into one animated gif - \"the amazingly fine shrinking kitty\"  mom and pop are proud of my progress (which really should have begun 10 years ago - but ni modo) and that makes me feel fine. im such a needy kitty, requiring validation at every turn. this is why I would make a splendid rock star. Vh1 presents, \"behind the kitty\" HAH  14 day average 135 - looking good.  about one hour nad a half after ingesting at least 20 carbs, 11 of which were grains, my blood is 112, excellent as mr. burns would say, excellent well.. got my butt out of bed and had some celery and spinach dip 3 carbs, a whole avacado 6 carbs and 2 low carb waffles 11 carbs  total today, about 24 carbs. i feel okay tho, not fainty. this morning it was 125, but i ate late.. and I didnt take any meds until 9am.. @ noon, it was 96. I had 3 deviled half eggs, a handful of almonds and prettymuch forced myself into a map/ its 3:15 and I pretty, much havent eaten anything today. also.. if my moms scale is correct, i lost 9 pounds.  beej wants to go to the movies, but we\\'ve already seen potter. what else is there?? aft blood 89!!!!  forgot to bring my pill box tho. 2 eggs and a whole avacado for breakfast 8 carbs and nothing since  hell yes again!  dont feel too bloaty. but woke up in the middle of the night with horrendous cramps at 330 today my blood was 99 and I had 2 protien burgers - 22 carb-os  taking my meds now, and going to eat in about 30 min, i shouldnt eat this late, i will be bloaty and stuff in the morning, and tho it will be lo carb and my total daily carbs should be under 60..  having a caca day, cant seem to get off the friggin phone, one thing after another and i am going to miss the hollywood calls  at 7:45 I ate a waffle - 5.5 carbs - and took my meds. about an hour later i\\'m at 126 - i think thats pretty good HELL YES!  :) took my meds about 9:30 last night.. but didnt eat after (ate before - steak and broccoli)  had a TJ waffle for breakfast. so tasty, i cant believe its only 5.5 carbs. aft blood 110finally, somewhat normal, but i haven\\'t eaten since 11 AMfour eggs con chorizo 4 carbs.  one lo-carb waffle 5.5 carbs, one cup lo-carb milk 3 carbs  this is ridiculous. I had one low carb Trader Joes bluberry waffle - 5 carbs (supposedly) and two meds. so what gives!  plus im hungry.plus im hungry.  plus im hungry. caca. one day of cheating, a little cheating mind you.... I probably had about 150-200 carbs yesterday and I took all my meds. when I think of how  i was eating just until a week ago.. i shudder.. i would take in, hmm.... 400-600 a day easy i\\'m sure. and on days when i had a sweet tooth. argh.i feel like im going to explode. i can\\'t worry about whats done, its done. but tis scary to think of the future. ever vigilant.if i can lose the weight, at least 50 pounds, then i beleive my sugars will react better. hopefully the glucophage therapy will beat my ovaries into submission and assist. but menopause approaches and its going to be a downhill battle.not a good morning.plus, someone bought my company. I\\'ll get the scoop at the 8am conference call. at least its LA based, not dallas, perhaps they will be more sensative to our gas plight and jack up the milage.  4 hours later my blood sugar is 146 which is not good dammit. never again  day 8 and i cheated. and it was bad food! i ordered stroganoff, lite noodles, but it was more like congealed beef stew over noodles? i only had a few egg noodels, like less than 1/4 cup, but the meat tasted real flour-y and i had a small slice of banana bread. 50-80 carbs for this bullshit meal, and i will probably get tummy cramps to boot. live and learn, should sprang for the t-bone!!  11 AM and i havent eaten anything, nor did i take my meds, blood sugar is 165 this means meds are key, food, not so much. going to take meds and eat a big lunch now. ta!  rock on. took meds 14 hours ago, but did not eat after about 7:3 0or so. woke up feeling very light.urlLink Palm Store - Factory Outlet: palmOneï¿½ Tungstenï¿½ T3 Open Box Handheld  this is the one for me, 110$ discount for open box plus, join palm book club and get another 100 bucks off (but pay 10-15 bucks a month for one year) which is kinda like credit.... plus I get a free book once a month. so total out of pocket is 188$ for a kick ass palm, plus hardcase and 2 cradles.i need 500$ for the phone and the palm. and I need it quick.urlLink Sanyo - Dual-Band Tri-Mode PCS Cell Phone w/Camera (Sprint) - Blue - PM8200KITU  i think i\\'m going to go with this one, I\\'ll go to best buy and see.but I also need to pay off the last ticket, pay off Ian\\'s camping trip, and get myself to the bodyartexpo where I might like to spend a little money dammit.urlLink this is the baby I wantbut its a shell out of 279 plus tax which I can ill afford and weight 2 months for the 150 back. well of course the blogging honeymoon is over.also I need to get a new domain, got paid today, will do this weekend. create several blog in blogs, with carb and blood counters. yahoootie!  been up and down and losing no weight with this puppy, really just trying to keep blood down.

I had 2 bowls of kale soup for dinner. maybe kale and garbanzo beans is a sugar inhibitor? whats the dillio?pre dinner yesgterday 104, morning bl0od yesterday 81 (took meds at midnight) after dinner blood monday, 116 pre dinner 108, pre lunch 94, morning blood monday 76!! after dinner blood sunday 98, pre dinner 84, morning bllod sunday 108, bedtime blood sat 89, after dinner blood sat (after 2 peices of 11 carb each bread and some cereal with peaches, within one hour) 155.and so it goes. sat I slept all night... sunday night i was up till 4am, monday night i woke up at 1 and was up till 3:30 am.. same as tuesday... finally last night I got a full nights sleep.  i\\'m just so confused about these fluctuations.less than 2 hours later, my sugar is up 20 fucking points to 93, and I have not eaten anything, nor did I go back to sleep. life sucks.  last night I had two chicken sausages (with fontina garlic and spinach, yum) and a small salad and  glipizid, and about ano hour later, 2 klondike 5 carb icecream ba I was going to take the glucophage at midnightish, but I fell asleep. my blood before dinner was 84, before lunch ws 68 and now I am afraid to take the glucophage again, I dont want it to raise..

The pain in my shoulder woke me at 1:30, took glucophage, another bowl of soup, and couldnt fall back asleep until 4 am.. I hope this isnt theproper puzzle peice, i am tired.  and thats because i didn\\'t wake up until 9. i guess i\\'m going to have to early to bed, early to rise!',\n",

I just spent some time playing with the beta version of  urlLink Atmosphere , Adobe\\'s new 3D environment software, and thought I\\'d give a couple of quick impressions. I\\'ve always been interested in VR and spent quite a bit of time working in VRML, but I think the inherant problem with VRML was that not enough attention had been given to community.  You could build all these really cool places but people couldn\\'t interact in them.  You also couldn\\'t easily move from one 3D environment to another without going back and forth between 2D web pages.  I was involved with a project that tried to solve some of these problems with VRML (anybody remember Terra Vista?) but it didn\\'t as far as we would have liked.  Atmosphere appears to have addressed these problems.  It\\'s not the first product to do so, but maybe Adobe has enough muscle for it to gain wide acceptance.

Now in Mindjack, a review of the  urlLink Xircom Wireless LAN Module  for Palm m500 handhelds.  A subject that only Cory Doctorow could make this interesting.Four or five years ago, I had a sea-change in my computing experience. One day, I realized that I had started to view any computer not connected to the Internet as just a fancy game-console-cum-jumped-up-typewriter. Working on an airplane or from a café just felt wrong. This feeling deepened and magnified a thousandfold the day I got my first iBook and Airport Base Station. If you\\'ve used wireless networking on a laptop, you know what I\\'m talking about -- snatching the Internet out of the very air is an experience you won\\'t go back from willingly (another one is TiVo -- I\\'ve stopped watching TV in hotel rooms because I can\\'t choose among thirty hours of custom-recorded programming and skip commercials). Just as TiVo ruined me for dumb TV, 802.11 ruined me for wired networking or no networking at all. And it keeps on getting better. 802.11 isn\\'t just a technology, it\\'s a movement, an ad-hoc world of open base-stations around the world. Just haul out your 802.11-equipped device and start hunting about for a network. If you\\'re in a major city, chances are you\\'ll find one before you go a block. Forget 3G and Blackberry and all those other pale imitations of connectivity: community wireless is the real shit: fast, unmetered, insecure and out of control.

I was pleasantly surprised by the breadth and depth of the presentations.Wednesday night.  Hit the media session and got to see some graphics on a really big screen. The theme of this international digital media festival was the \"4-D challenge\", to go beyond the third dimension. I would deem this festival to be a success overall, as by the end of the festival it would be apparent that there was much speculation on what constitutes this fourth dimension. Now that I\\'ve spoiled the ending and gotten that out of the way, on with the festival itself.  The original vision was for local (Toronto) participation, but it quickly expanded in scope with the arrival of international submissions. There was a soirée before the keynote where attendees could snack on catered food and mingle. Quite a few people were there, many of them either dressed hip or stylishly. I almost felt that I was underdressed, but I just put on my best casual face and it was all cool. Business cards flowed like water.I got an iBook!

This week\\'s Mindjack:  urlLink Reading McLuhan  by Melanie McBride.  If there\\'s a message of the \\'for dummies\\' age it\\'s that nothing is beyond our grasp. And our desire to believe this is reinforced by trends like usability, which privilege economy over elucidation. No one anticipated it all better than Marshall McLuhan, who whittled big insights into sound bites in order to engage an audience beyond the lecture halls of the University of Toronto. With the help of Tom Wolfe and others, the scholarly McLuhan became a cool media prophet. It was, and still is, a practical strategy in anti-intellectual times. But in the process, much of McLuhan\\'s meaning has been reduced to a one-liner. This has as much to do with the absence of commentary on McLuhan\\'s literary, philosophical and cultural influences as it does with the way his work is taught.The new issue of Mindjack deals with one of my favorite topics:  urlLink Robots!  My submission to the  urlLink Burn Baby Burn  mix CD swap, with dispraportionate amounts of Bowie and Reed, of course.urlLink  (click to read tracklist)Mindjack advisory board member Douglas Rushkoff has started  urlLink a blog .Expect good things.  Not that you\\'\\'d expect anything less, but the  urlLink Criterion Collection  website is really excellent.  It\\'s similar the old  urlLink Criterion Goes To The Movies  CD-ROM, which is also worth checking out.  Although it takes some work to get it to run on any computer made in the last six or seven years.  Both are filled with great essays on some of the best moves ever. We\\'ve got a  urlLink great interview with Simon Singh , author of  The Code Book , in the new issue of Mindjack.Gadzooks, it\\'s been a long time since I last posted.  Sorry.  I interview  urlLink Derek Powazek  in the new Mindjack, in which he talks about online community, his book and weblogs as journalism. Mindjack is trying out a new guerrila advertising campaign.  Feel free to use either of this ads on your weblog or website.More to come soon.urlLink Mindjack  is back!Now to get back to work on this site.  urlLink Mindjack interviews Warren Ellis!  So why aren\\'t you reading comics these days?  Really, it doesn\\'t seem to me that there are many comics being written for me. I want something with a little more muscle and bite than standard-issue power fantasies, whimsical romance, the autobiographies of people who never do anything and things with elves. The Western medium has cycles, and it\\'s currently in a creative downturn. That doesn\\'t mean there isn\\'t excellent work being done. That simply means there\\'s not much of it. And, on a personal level, little of it is talking to me. Not many comics reflect the fact that I live in a multicultural society fitted with a global communications net, nor do they reflect the fact that I don\\'t own a pair of Superman underpants.Howard Rheingold  urlLink interviewed on NPR  (RealAudio link).  I still haven\\'t gotten my copy of  urlLink Smart Mobs  yet, but hope to soon. Mindjack\\'s Jim Lai checks out an art exhibit in the form of a billboard:  Transmedia 2002\\'s  urlLink 15 Seconds of Fame.  Now in Mindjack:urlLink Cybersecurity Nosebleed  by Sarah Granger \"Security is the newest over-hyped commodity in the United States. I keep visualizing driving down highway 101 past billboards that read: \"Big government wants big security\" along with a picture of an ape beating on its chest. Somehow as seriously as they say they are, I\\'m not convinced.\"urlLink Mindjack\\'s back , with a proper relaunch this time after a bit of a slow start last month.  We\\'ve got a lengthy article on Lawrence Lessig by Bryan Alexander this issue, plus my review of the neat little l\\'espion digital camera.  Spread the word! I\\'m kicking myself for missing the  urlLink David Bowie concert  on BBC Radio 2 today.  But at least I was able to find a couple of the songs  urlLink somewhere else .Bewlay Brothers is amazing. In case anyone\\'s sitting on the edge of their site, rest assured the Mindjack relaunch is still on track for Monday.  Get the word out. I can\\'t get enough of CBC\\'s  urlLink 50th anniversary  specials.  I wish they\\'d start a cable channel and show nothing but stuff from the 50s and 60s (and 70s and 80s too). I just got  urlLink Syberia  and  urlLink Post Mortem , two promising new adventure games from Montreal-based developer  urlLink Microids .  As you might be able to judge from some of my posts here, I\\'m a big fan of adventure games.  The traditional kind, where you can carry an enormous inventory in your pants, and explore the game at your own pace.  I\\'ve been thinking a lot about the genre lately and plan to write something about it soon, aside from reviews of the aforementioned games.  I\\'m interested in hearing your thoughts on adventure games.  Do you think there\\'s a place for them today?  What are your favorite games? src=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/18/iaMjuWreTAS.js\">urlLink Commentsdocument.write(\"(\" + ct_18_iaMj + \")\");  This doesn\\'t bode well for me getting much work done this weekend.  The Adrenaline Vault\\'s  urlLink Best Shareware of 2002  Justin Hall on South Korea:  urlLink korea will be televised .  TVs in cabs, TVs in subways, and stacks and stacks of tiny, tiny televisions to take with you.But I was still able to enjoy more television, this time in the Seoul subway. Televisions up in the subways, instead of static ad bulletin boards! This is the future! It\\'s fun to see and fun to watch now. Soon it might be annoying or normal. But this first brush with more constant televisual stimulation was definitely exciting.  I\\'d like to comment on  urlLink Movielink , the new studio-approved online movie rental service, but unfortunately this is all I\\'m able to see:Sign #249  urlLink CNN  needs some sense slapped into them:  it\\'s the day after an election, Republicans have taken control the Senate, Dick Gephardt is stepping down as House minority leader and right now, on Larry King, they\\'re talking about the Winona Ryder verdict.  At least they took down the  BREAKING NEWS  graphic. There\\'s a  urlLink new trailer  for Steven Soderbergh\\'s  Solaris  up today -- one of the movies I\\'m most looking forward this fall.  I got a copy of the great DVD release of Tarkovsky\\'s  urlLink original film  from  urlLink The Russian Cinema Council  a short while ago.  Which I hope to review for Mindjack before the new film\\'s released. Cory Doctorow  urlLink reviews Smart Mobs  in the new Mindjack: Smart Mobs are the Slashdot effect applied to the meatspace zeitgeist. A squillion like-minded souls who don\\'t know each other and will never meet pop out of the transmetropolitan brickface and break the white-noise balance of atomic viewpoints to speak with one voice, roaring a righteous YES or an adamant NO without organizers, without leaders, without manifestoes or forethought.Also this issue, an in-depth look at  urlLink the Internet Archive  by Doug Roberts.Tucked away in one of the seediest neighborhoods of San Francisco is a roomful of over two hundred computers with a terabyte of data stored on every three. Stairs from the street lead up an intimidating hallway that opens into a room with 15-foot ceilings and just-this-side of hip ductwork in the ceiling. To the right is a storage area with a single desk, to the left are Baker\\'s racks tightly packed with off-the-shelf HP desktop machines, each turned on it\\'s side to maximize the space. Somewhere in all that ductwork, a fan is squeaking painfully. Walking into this echoey, over-warm warehouse space, it\\'s easy to be underwhelmed until you realize what you are looking at: spinning away on these computers is nothing less than a copy of the Internet from 1996 until today.Mindjack is back after a short break.  The new issue has  urlLink a report  on the Supernova conference by Doug Roberts.  Supernova 2002 was an ambitious conference and Kevin Warbach, the organizer along with pulver.com, acknowledged that from the outset when he said that he had crammed a three day conference into two days. The conference was touted as a glimpse into the decentralized future. Decentralized systems, as may be obvious, are systems that have no single point of control - the Internet is a perfect example. No one entity or agency controls it, no single server provides the service, and no single point of failure will bring down the system. Warbach sees these types of systems as the fundamental issue in computing for the next decade. By then end of day one, however, it became clear that the conference was going to be about one thing: blogging.  I just discovered through  urlLink Smartmobs.com  that Clive Thompson has a  urlLink blog .  It\\'s great.  Which reminds me, I really need to update the blogroll on this site. Doug Roberts is covering  urlLink Supernova  for Mindjack and  urlLink blogging it live .Sometimes Amazon.com is just plain eerie. If you\\'re going to be in Los Angeles on February 15, don\\'t miss  urlLink Live from the Blogosphere , a panel discussion to be put on by Rhizome.LA and moderated by Xeni Jardin.  \"Live from the Blogosphere!\" brings together six innovators in blogging: Mark Frauenfelder, Heather Havrilesky, Evan Williams, Susannah Breslin, Doc Searls, and Tony Pierce. The panel will discuss the birth of blogging, the emergent tension between blogs and traditional journalism, innovations in blogging such as video-blogging, audio-blogging, and mobile-blogging, the shifting roles of race and gender in the Blogosphere, the state of the blog economy, and the way blogs may be reshaping contemporary media.(cross-posted from  urlLink Daily Relay ) I review a cool laptop bag today in  urlLink Daily Relay . Douglas Rushkoff meets Al Gore and is  urlLink suitably impressed .He was a much brighter, open-minded, and - if I might add - cosmic thinker than I gave him credit for, before. I felt like he was really one of \"us,\" if you know what I mean: the kids in college who got those wild thoughts about how everything in the world, and even beyond, is connected somehow. And evolving. Only Gore found this organic view of reality reflected in the Constitution of the United States, and sought to enable the extension of this Enlightenment thinking into practical reality.  New Mindjack up today!  Cory Doctorow on  urlLink William Gibson .  Justin Hall on  urlLink Super Monkey Ball 2 . Check out  urlLink this preview  of Warren Ellis and Colleen Doran\\'s new graphic novel,  urlLink Orbiter .  Ah crap.urlLink Shift magazine publishes its last issue .  Shift has pulled out from dire situations before, but this looks to be the end, which is a real shame.  They\\'ve been a consistently great magazine and an important voice in the ever-changing sphere of digital culture.  The final issue is due out in two weeks, I urge everyone to pick up a copy. Mindjack\\'s been  slashdotted .  urlLink The Fray  redesigned for the first time in over six years.  Blog coming soon.  urlLink Deepsky  have posted their remix of David Bowie\\'s \"I Took a Trip an a Gemini Spaceship\" on their website.  Not as good as the original, but worth a listen.urlLink RealAudio linkurlLink This post  by Warren Ellis to his blog isn\\'t just cool because he linked to Mindjack:  At Bruce Sterling\\'s house in Austin, Texas, Howard Waldrop beams Cory Doctorow an mp3 of some swampy old rock\\'n\\'roll from the dawn of time. The next day, across town, his powerbook scorching the flesh off his legs, he beams it over to me in England. I put it up on a private server for Fraction in Kansas City and Laurenn in San Francisco, while reading the first few chapters of Cory\\'s new book, which he sent to me from an airport a few days before, squatting by the power outlet next to the public toilets.  urlLink continued...Slashdot launches  urlLink games.slashdot.org  and, holy cow, it\\'s ugly. Mindjack contributor and game reviewer, Justin Hall, has written a great article on  urlLink ethics in video game journalism  for the Online Journalism Review.  The first print magazine covering video games Electronic Games was co-founded by Bill Kunkel in 1981.  Kunkel describes those early days in a recent interview: \\x93To an extent, we were cheerleaders for the industry -- we loved these games, we wanted to see more of them, we wanted to keep writing about them.\\x94  Not much has changed in the past 20 years.  Game publications and Web sites still mostly employ low-paid hobbyists who are easy targets of lavish marketing events that encourage inappropriate ties between game makers and game critics. This is incredible.  Scientists have discovered a \"Colossal\" squid in the Antartic, much bigger than the previous biggest giant squid found.  And it\\'s not even fully grown.  Deep sea exploration is nearly as fascinating to me as space exploration.  Just imagine that there\\'s something like this that no one has ever seen alive.  It\\'s interesting that the article notes the funding for the research is from the Discovery Channel.  While it\\'s great there\\'s some funding available, just as with space exploration, there should be much more. Googling for sites that mention Mindjack, other than mindjack.com, suprisingly results in 5,800 links.  I like the description on  urlLink this one .  Mindjack Magazine.

If you want to write for us, drop an email. I\\'m pleased to announce that VRML creator and all-around visionary Mark Pesce has joined Mindjack\\'s ever-growing stable of writers.  His first article,urlLink Redefining Television  , is an insightful examination of the state and future of the medium.  Here\\'s a snippet:In the earliest days of television, writers like George Orwell in  1984  and Ray Bradbury in  Fahrenheit 451  projected television as the instrumentality of a totalitarian future - a monolithic entity dispensing propaganda. And, if any of you occasionally watch Fox News, you can see they weren\\'t that far off the mark. But here\\'s the thing: the monolithic days of television are numbered. Actually, they\\'ve already passed - though, as yet, very few people realize this.  To understand why, we need to go back to first principles. What is television? Here\\'s a functional definition:Television is the capture, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display of moving images.This definition applies to the Golden Age of television, and to the present era. Yet the definition of every word in the definition of television has changed, because of the introduction of digital production, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display technologies.  I\\'m using this blog to play around with  urlLink Blogger\\'s new features .  It will return to normal shortly. I\\'m blogging a lot more on my  urlLink film blog  than I am here.

              " ' About to go t bed late (again) got sucked into (another) late night film. Tonight was  urlLink Maybe Baby . It was really good made me think, but not about babies. The guy screws up his marriage and it made me think about making sure, everyday, that mine is tip top. If I\\'m honest there are areas that we are just getting by in - so I need to resolve to sort them out now before they are a problem. In the film they both keep diaries so I thought I should blog tonight.Weekend was hectic but great fun. Not that long ago k and I had to work on spending time with other people as a couple. This weekend we never ate alone, except breakfast. K, P and I went for a very breif trip on the river saturday durring a gap in the weather. K stripped off and went for a swim, I love her so much.Tonight we went out for dinner. It was a lovely evening, the first in weeks, so we ate at the Bridge and sat outside, next to the  urlLink river . My Dad has always wanted to go to  urlLink America . I have been several times, for holidays, to see friends or for work. I\\'d love to go with Dad and go on a long road trip. Would make a better blog than this.  ...is a guy painting a blue wall blue.  Can\\'t the  urlLink weather  just sort itself out. I\\'m sure we\\'d already had 2 heat waves by this point last year. I look out of my window on yet another grey day. I wouldn\\'t mind but this is the last free weekend I\\'ll have in a while I want to be out enjoying it.  Yesterday we wrote some thank you cards. Kirsten worked on the garden and I bottled my latest batch of  urlLink beer . In the evening Anna and Jon came around for dinner. I made a lasagne, for the first time, and it was good fun. I\\'d not been feeling too great all day and was exhausted by bed time.  This morning K felt ill and stayed in bed. I was stewarding at church and as usual I was put on car parking. We(I) messed up giving out the buckets for the offering but it was ok. After church I dropped some firewood around to Liz and dropped off K\\'s keys while I was there. Liz wasn\\'t in but I saw paddy through the back door as I left the wood.  I don\\'t feel that great myself. Might be time to join K in the sick bed.  At last back to a normal company where it expected that you go to the pub at lunch on Fridays. Plus they have free breakfast (quite a spread too!). Good to do a bit of socialising.  Induction, on Monday, was in a building right opposite the  urlLink gherkin . If I\\'d known I would have taken my camera. I had a bit of time to kill after getting off the train so I went for a bit of a wander around the city.  So I\\'ve been in the Cambridge office for 3 days now. The job is good and the people friendly. There is no tuckshop which will be good for my waistline but currently I\\'m craving snacks!  My  urlLink HDD case  arrived on Tuesday. I had a few problems at first getting it working with the aluminum case on but once I added a bit of card under the circuit board to act as insulation it worked fine. It is really small, hardly bigger than a 2.5\" drive and it works really well.  Also to arrive on Tuesday was the adoption certificate for my gibbon. NCorp  urlLink adopted  me a gibbon to remind me of them as my leaving gift. I\\'m sure that I have a part share in a whole troop of gibbons but I like to think there is one that\\'s mine. I have called him Dobbo.  Andy  Anita came to dinner on Tuesday night. After dinner the whole proceedings kind of deteriorated into Kirsten and Anita playing the drums while Andy tried to fix my  urlLink sparc station . Much fun was had by all.  Yesterday Labhaoise passed her driving test so K and her when to look at cars together. Pete, Labhaoise, K and I went to see  urlLink Shrek 2  in the evening which was really good.  Labhaoise was going to drive us home but then the lights in Pete\\'s car broke (again) so he drove us back to our house. Pete and I  urlLink fixed  the lights so Labhaoise could drive the car back to their house.Welcome back. Well sort of, I discovered that my old blog from 2000 was still on the blogger.com server. I read the thirteen posts and they were really dull so I deleted the blog. It was from the days when I was living with my Dad after uni and working for Pilks. It was a month or two before I went to work in the USA which would have made a much more interesting blog had I done it.  Tomorrow I\\'m off to London for my induction meeting at my new company. I\\'m so relieved to leave NCorp that I haven\\'t really given the new place much thought. I\\'m sure it will be great, I was really into the new place 3 months ago when I got the job but  urlLink the pangalactic bellwether in miserable notice periods  has kind of taken the sparkle off it a bit.  At least the train ride down will give me time to write to manda - haven\\'t been in touch since the wedding - bad pen pal!',\n",
              " ' Entry originally posted on 8 August 2003 .  This is not a journal in the traditional sense of the word. This is an exploration, a new beginning mapped out through language and metaphor. There are a great many changes that are taking place in my life. Tommorrow, I will become a mother to a tuxedo cat named Demeter. In two weeks, I will be starting graduate school, embarking on a life-long journey into the world of academia. My friend, Julius has joined the Navy and will be shipped off to basic training next week. Lots of changes.  So, this space is a reflection of those changes, the need to write and think beyond the traditional weblog, livejournal, or daily journal. This space will be composed of ideas, broad themes, academic pursuits, and the occasional antedote about graduate school and life, in general.  There will not be an archive section, because the purpose of this space is to write and live in the present and not rehash the past nor to dwell on the future.Right now, I am walking in darkness. \"For the love of God is broader that the measure of the mind And the heart of the Eternal is most wonderfully kind.\" -Our Lady of Mount Carmel Hymn  Michael was the first openly gay man that I met in life. Every day after World Literature we would walk to the college cafeteria and eat lunch together, sometimes studying for a test, but mostly we discussed his sexuality and his faith. I was curious about him, about how he could be both gay and Christian. I grew up in a Southern Baptist tradition that labeled homosexuals as deviants who were out to corrupt Godde-fearing people. Listening and learning about life through the eyes of scared adults, anything and everything can be painted as black or white, right or wrong, and good or evil. When you are a child, it is hard to see the that the world is comprised of multiple shades of grey. Therefore, it is easy, too easy, to judge others for their differences, because you are not yet comfortable in your own skin.  At a time when I was advocating at the top of my lungs against institutionalized Christianity, Michael was advocating in favor of the church. It baffled me that he did not consider it a paradox, a contradiction, or an oxy-moron to be a gay man and a Christian. I did not understand how he could support and participate in an institution that stated that Godde hated him for who he loved. Michael told me that he believed that Godde is merciful, kind, and loving, rather than a vindictive deity that is pissed at the world. \"Sometimes the people in charge of the religion,\" he said, \"get so wrapped up in the rules that they forget about the message. The message of Godde, of Christ, is ultimately about love for your fellow man.\" A few weeks later, Michael broke down another barrier of prejuidice that resided inside me. He told me that he was HIV positive. I remember that we had been sharing a basket of french fries and I was paralyzed with fear at the thought of contracting the disease. Now, I realize that it was a naive and foolish fear, but at that time it was a life-altering experience, because it showed me that who you sleep with is insignificant in the grand scheme of life.  I never saw Michael after that semester. I tried to track him down several times, but never succeeded and I have moments when I wonder if he is even still walking among us. I am convinced that he was an angel, a messenger sent to me by Godde to teach me about compassion, honesty, and love. In light of recent events that have taken place within my community of faith, I have thought about my friendship with Michael more and more and I often wonder what he would think of all this controversy surrounding a gay man that wants to bring people closer to Godde. To me it is clear that Godde places people in our lives to teach, inspire, and make us better human beings. Godde does not discriminate and I am very proud of the Episcopal church for recognizing that truth by ordaining Gene Robinson. I will stand by my church and my faith, regardless of the political ramifications that come from this decision. It is my firm belief that, eventually, we will all have to answer for our actions. To the individuals that are quick to suggest that Gene Robinson will be punished by Godde for his relationship with a man, may I remind you all that casting judgement is also considered to be a sin. Instead of pointing fingers, learn from this man. Open your hearts and embrace the message that is being sent to you. A couple of years ago, I wrote a short story entitled, \"Faith is a Funny Thing.\" I wrote this story at a time in my life when my quest for spiritual direction was beginning to resemble a fruitless search for a needle in a haystack. In the story, a young woman find solace in a dusty cathedral, the very institution that she spent years denouncing. It was a piece that would foreshadow my return to the church in the years to come.  I was a spiritual pilgrim for the span of a decade, researching and practicing a variety of religions. I attended a service at a Jewish synagogue, read Thich Nhat Hanh\\'s  Living Buddha, Living Christ , held a full moon ritual in my living room, and attended Catholic Mass on a Sunday afternoon. In Yann Martel\\'s  The Life of Pi , the main character, Pi, practices a multiplicity of religions and sees no conflict in his syncretism. Halfway through the book, Pi and his family are walking through town and are approached by the leaders of the local temple, church, and mosque. Each leader tells Pi that he must chose a religion to practice. He can be a devout Hindu, Christian, or Muslim, but he can not practice all three faiths at the same time. Pi remarks that all he wants to do is love God. The church leaders are speechless at the simplicity of that statement.  I love to tell people the story of my return to the church. I tell them that I am a Christian because of a conversation that I had with a Pagan. My good friend, Loria, listened to me rant on and on about my spiritual crisis until finally she told me that there was no shame in being Christian. She reminded me that there are a lot of interpretations of what it means to be a Christian, that Jesus was a profound teacher and prophet, and that a great deal of beauty remains in the Christian tradition. You just have to find a community that you feel comfortable attending. I did.  I am an Episcopalian. I am an open-minded, syncretic, goddess-loving, liberal, Celtic Christian-Buddhist. I believe that Jesus was sent to the Earth to teach and inspire humankind. I believe that Godde is both masculine and feminine and that He/She resides in every single heart that beats on this planet. I am addicted to Sufi poetry, Buddhist philosophy, and Celtic rituals. Religion, faith, is not about the rules, but what road the heart travels. If our motive in life is to love Godde, regardless of the form that being/spirit takes, then does it really matter how we go about expressing that love? My answer is no, it does not matter. Rituals, words, and theology are wonderful things until they begin to place limitations on a person\\'s soul. In the end, what matters the most is how that person uses their faith in the world. Their actions towards other human beings are a reflection of their interpretation of Godde.  The rest is just ashes and dust.  I believe in eating. I think women especially have this fear of eating, and I think there is a whole euphoric plane you can rise to when you have a good meal. You sit down and with every bite you honestly just say thank you. (Tori Amos)  I was eight years old when I went on my first diet. I have this memory of standing on the scales in the pediatrician\\'s office and hearing the doctor tell my mother that I was fat. As an adult, I look at pictures taken of me during that time and I often wonder what the doctor was thinking. I looked like a healthy, active eight year old girl. My mother immediately put me on a diet. She gave my grandmother the strictest orders not to let me eat anything other than cantaloupe for a snack. Nan took pity on me after the second week of scarfing down cantaloupe; she gave me cookies and ate the fruit herself. I have not eaten cantaloupe since that summer.  My weight haunts me. It speaks to me, nit-picks me in the guise of voices from the past; Lance Crane telling our fifth grade classmates that there would be no more ice cream left once I went through the serving line, the constant pressure of being stick thin in high school, and my best guy friend from college telling me that men did not like girls with guts and if I wanted a boyfriend then I would have to lose weight, because no guy would want me otherwise. These are the things that I think about when I am in the presence of a man, even if that man is my lover. I know that it does not do well to dwell on the past, but when you spend your life hearing that you are less because you are more, it is hard to believe that beauty resides within your body.  I do not blame my mother for her obsession with my weight. It seems that she too was contantly struggling with her self-esteem in that realm. In her mind big was a simple translation for ugly and so I can not hold her actions against her, because she was suffering from the same societal ideals of beauty. She was struggling to feel beautiful and she wanted me to not have that struggle. It amazes me how many beautiful women, who I am surrounded by on a daily basis, think that they are hiddeous. I read my livejournal, talk to my co-workers, listen to my friends; all of them think that they are less than wonderful, because this world, this culture tells them that they are worthless unless they have Sarah Jessica Parker\\'s body, a body that has no curves, very little cleavage, and is nothing but skin drawn taunt over bone. How is that beautiful?  I stand in front of the mirror naked and I like what I see. I walk around my apartment without clothes, because I am, finally, learning to be comfortable in my own skin. It has nothing to do with being sexy, although if you ask me I will tell you that I am sexy, and everything to do with feeling at ease with the woman that I have become. Yes, I want to lose a few more pounds, for health reasons. Next week, I am going back to the pool and swimming laps, because I miss the feel of the water between my thighs and the burning in my lungs when I am holding my breathe. I want to, once again, be addicted to the feel of gliding through the water. I used to swim two miles non-stop, the equivalent of 72 laps in an Olympic-size pool, and I want that to happen again.  Until then, I will continue to stand in front of the mirror and celebrate my hips that could bring children into this world with great ease, my breasts that are full and lovely and tinted at the tips with a shade of pink, and my back, which is smooth and, in my opinion, flawless. I am a work of art, because Godde made me. As women, we must learn to embrace ourselves and not fall victim to the societal contructs of beauty. If society had its way, I would be the size of my letter-opener, quiet, docile, and submissive.  No. Fucking. Thank You.  This one is for you, Dad.I want to talk about censorship. I want to talk about what happens when you get home after a hard day and find that you father has left a message on your machine, telling you that he read your website and that he thinks that using the \"f-word\" to make a point is very inappropriate. If it were any other person, I would launch into a lecture about my right to free speech, free assembly, and the academic concept of language reclamation. However, when it is with my father, confrontation seems more difficult, because I was daddy\\'s little girl long before I was a feminist.  When you plant your feet, heart, mind, and soul under the banner of feminism, loving men reaches a level of frustration that is unparallel to any other experience. There are a great number of men who continue to identify feminism as an anti-male campaign. This is a lie. The complexity with feminism and my relationship with my father is that it is difficult to play out simultaneous roles. I can no longer play the role of dutiful daughter, because the woman inside me is demanding justice. I can no longer pretend that my father is a paragon of perfection, because humans are flawed. For any woman who once thought that her father walked on water, it is a hard lesson to learn when you discover that you are a disappointment to the man who gave you life.  I am sorry that I disappointed you, Dad. I am sorry that you think there is hypocrisy in my lifestyle because I use vulgar language and then call myself a Christian, but I will not censor myself for anyone, especially not for you. You were the person who taught me to be strong, to never settle, to always be true to myself, and to believe that I could do anything that I put my mind to. Now, you are telling me that the way that I conduct myself is inappropriate and even though you do not verbalize it, the insinuation in your message is this;  the man who I adore most in the world is ashamed of me.That is a bitter pill to swallow, even for the most ardent feminist. I still remember what it felt like to be the pride and joy in your life and thought it sounds selfish -even to my own ears- it hurts to even consider the possibility that those feelings are no longer present in your heart when you think of me. Sunday evening, I went to church for the first time since my confirmation in June. It is pathetic and sad, how distracted I became this past summer. Lust overcame my heart and I pulled away from Godde, deserting my faith for the simple pleasures of the skin. Yet, when the inevitable happened and that man disappeared from my life, I found myself clinging to my faith like a life-raft. Godde became my glue and she held me together during that horrible time, when I felt him slip through my fingers. Godde continues to hold me together as I am writing these words.  It felt like coming home when I received communion. I could feel this overwhelming sense of purpose and direction flood through my body, melting into my soul. When I tasted the bread, for the first time in months, it had a dry bitter flavor, but it connected me with the others in the church. When I drank the wine, I could feel the blood of Christ renewing me, strenghtening me, preparing me for the road ahead. Catholics believe that the Eucharist involves the process of transubstantiation, where the bread and wine are, literally, the body and blood of Christ. Episcopalians recognize this belief, but tend to view the Eucharist as a symbolic act, rather than a literal one.  In my opinion, Christianity is about the blessing of this sacrament. Long before there were numerous denominations, the early Christians were meeting in secret to receive bread and wine. They risked persecution, even became martyrs, for this simple act. The Eucharist is an invisible rope that, through this acknowledgement of the sacrifice of Christ, binds Christians to one another.  Growing up in a Southern Baptist tradition, I received communion during two services a year, Christmas and Easter. I never considered communion to be an active part of the faith and when I started attending services at the Episcopal church, I thought it strange that Episcopalians received the Eucharist every single Sunday without fail. Now, I can no longer imagine going to church and not receiving communion before I go out into the world. It is the ultimate business card,  please, take our Savior with you. His body and blood are yours, if you wish to carry it inside of you . It is an incredible gift.  This is the reason that I am a Christian. The Eucharist brought me comfort when my relationship with Gene was falling apart. I know that there are a number of theological interpretations within the world-wide Christian community, so many that at times it seems as if that community will fall apart. The Eucharist is what binds us together in the face of adversity and change. It is an integral part of the faith. It is what brings Christians back into the church, even after they have been gone for days, weeks, months, and even years.  It is a blessing. It is home. Fortune cookies are beautiful things. I get excited, like a school-girl in a candy shop, at the very thought of what the Fates are contemplating sending in my direction. I hold on to my fortunes, those little paper notes that following in the wake of a simple cracking of a cookie.  I have it taped to my computer monitor, this one fortune that reminds me to savor life and live for the moment.  You will discover the truth in time . I meditate on these words every single day, searching for a better understanding of what they mean in relation to my life. At first, I thought the note was a message from Godde about my ex-boyfriend, putting me at ease about our troubled relationship, letting me know that we would overcome our differences and move forward together. How naive was I, to think that I knew the meaning of truth, the meaning of time?  There are moments in my life, where I feel like I am in a rush to learn everything at once. I worry that I will run out of time and that I will never discover the truth about myself, this world, and Godde. I obsess over the fear that I will never find a safe, comfortable, loving relationship with a man. There are so many items that occupy my mind, that drive me to distraction. It is only my faith, my love for Godde, that allows me to take a deep breath and force these thoughts out of my mind. I remind myself that there is a plan, a purpose.  Despite the presence of my fears, I feel more grounded now than I have at any other point in my life. I have a wonderful job and my career goals for the future have come full circle in the wake of my return to school. I am surrounded by the most incredible support network of family and friends. I go to an incredible church, a place where I am encouraged to think about my faith instead of blindly accepting doctrine. I have a cat who adores me. Truly, I am a blessed woman. I came here, once or twice since I last wrote, with no topic in my mind. I came here with a voice, but no words to give that voice a contextual meaning. What should I write about in this space? Should I tell you about my ex-boyfriend, how his memory continues to break me, even after he abdicated from my love? Should I discuss the weather, the change of colors and climate? Perhaps, I could write about my indecisiveness regarding the future; professional and personal?  With each passing day, I am becoming more of an introvert, more shy with the world. I enjoy my new-found solitude, but I would be lying if I did not admit that there are times when the loneliness hits me hard. There are times when I wish for a companion, preferably of the male variety. I want a man in my life, not for sex or romantic love, but for friendship, for those times when I need strong arms to hold me.  I am fully aware of my faults. I am stubborn, tempermental, loud, obsessive compulsive, and a hopeless romantic. I am passionate, almost to the point of being militant, about certain issues. I have no problem with expressing my opinion, to an individual or a crowd of people. I am an emotional eater. I have a vulgar sense of humor and a tendency to use excessive amounts of profanity in any given situation.  I am picky about spelling, punctuation, and style.  For all of my faults, I have just as many good qualities. I am intelligent. I write a mean research paper. I try to see beauty in everything. I have strong faith. I like to give back to my community. I want to make the world a better place to live, especially for women and children. I want to be a role model for young girls who are searching for an idenity in this crazy messed-up world. I am compassionate and giving. I put my all into my friendships and relationships. I love sex. (Of course there are some individuals who would argue that this is a negative quality. Screw them.) I am honest. Also, while I may never win the Miss America pagent and I know that I have some weight to lose, I do not believe that I am hard on the eyes. I can look myself in the mirror and see a valuable woman who posesses beauty, even if it is of the inward variety.  I am not perfect, but I have worth. October is a difficult month for me. Three years ago, Nan died on Friday the thirteenth.  She died in her sleep; she had sat down to take a nap during the middle of the day and when her daughter came home from work, she discovered that her mother was no longer among the living.  The funeral took place on what would have been an otherwise gorgeous autumn afternoon. As I watched her casket being lowered into the ground, I could not help but ponder the irony of burying my grandmother, my spiritual rock, on such a day as that one.  A couple of years later, my family buried our beloved pet, Freckles, after he lost a brief, yet painful, battle with liver disease, an ailment that is very common amongst male cocker spaniels. It happened so fast and I will never forget my mother calling me and tearfully telling me about his passing. She loved that dog.  It seems that there is so much pain in life. Sometimes, I want to wail against Godde, because I know that she has the power to cease the world\\'s suffering and sadness. Then, there are moments that I know I am growing stronger, because of the suffering that I have had to endure at times. The fall is the perfect time of year to reflect on that strength. In the tradition of the Celts, the autumn season has become my personal New Year\\'s celebration. I use this time to re-focus my goals, especially since I have a habit of getting distracted over the summer. This is the time of year that I pay homage to those individuals who have passed through the veil.  I miss her. There are still days where I feel an overwhelming need to hear her voice over the phone or to hold her hand. When I realize that this is no longer a possibility, there is a sharp pain that runs straight through my heart. It takes my breath away and I start to leak silent tears.  I watch the students in this college town. You would think they\\'re carefree, I have seen their trials, Frowning into Shakespeare and practicing their smiles, With every new idea, wondering if they\\'ve changed at all, Then they turn away, it happens every day.  - Dar Williams,  The Green World I want to talk about responsibility. Oftentimes, I feel that pressure of responsibility, the higher moral obligation to make the world a better place for us to live. There are those individuals who mock my idealistic desires, but for me, being an optimist is the only way to survive in this crazy place. My faith in Godde prevents me from becoming the World\\'s Greatest Cynic. I am a natural optimist, always wanting to see the good in people and their motivations, and I feel absolutely no shame about that fact.  Mother Teresa stated that, \"In this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love.\" Indeed, it is the small things that make the most difference. The environment is a good example of this point and I have made it a part of said higher obligation to protect the space in which I live. I drive a car that gets good gas-mileage and has the lowest emissions rating in the country. I car-pool to places when it is possible. I recycle paper, plastic, aluminium, and glass products. I take my own shopping bags, made out of thick cloth, to the grocery store and if I am forced to use the plastic bags, I keep and re-use them to carry my lunch to work during the week.  Perhaps it is naive of me to be so sure that my actions, alone, can change the world. Certainly, other people think in such terms. On more than one occasion, I have been labeled as a  bleeding heart , a  touchy-feely liberal , and a  hippie tree hugger . I have grown immune to such attempts at attacking my desire, my need, to keep this place clean. I refuse to believe that it is a bad thing to want to leave something beautiful for those who, years after I am gone, will walk this land. Godde did not give us this land to plunder with shameless abandon. When you rape the land, you are, for all intents and purposes, raping Godde, because  She is the land . This type of language, this violent metaphor, is harsh, but true. I am a firm believer in honesty, a trait which far too many individuals have lost sight of and no longer value. We are tied to this place. We are tied to Her. If we, as a society, destroy our planet, then we will be destroying the gift that Godde gave to us. We will be destroying our own lives, the lives of our children, and Godde Herself. I was never one of those girls. I never planned my wedding, most of my Barbie dolls eloped rather than having a frou-frou ceremony. I did not keep a scrapbook full of pictures of rings, dresses, and cakes. In college, when I first discovered feminism, I proclaimed at the top of my lungs that marriage was a patriarchal institution and there was no way that I was going to willingly participate in the ultimate downfall of women. Yet, the entire time that I went through that militant phase I had a dirty little secret.  I wanted to be married. I wanted to fall in love with a man.  Now, I am older and a bit wiser. I recognize that I can be both, a feminist and a wife. In the last few weeks, I have been contemplating this topic, mostly because I have a great number of friends who either are married or are engaged to be married. I find myself turning into one of those women; clipping dresses and rings out of magazines, thinking about ceremonies, but most of all looking for the ever elusive  Mr. Right . My feminist self knows that such a creature does not exist. I am too cynical to believe, truly, in faerytales. I am no longer viewing the world through child-like eyes. However, the hopeless romantic in me will not stop looking for this individual.  I would be lying if I said that I was not ready for love. I would love to be in a relationship with a man, a committed union with someone who wanted to spend his life with me. The problem is that I am not ready to give up all of the things that I would, most likely, need to sacrifice in order to be with this person; traveling abroad, working in Washington D.C., getting my doctorate. I am not sure if I am ready to be that unselfish with my time and energy.  What is problematic about this situation is that I give my heart away with too much ease. I am a hopeless romantic and caring for other people is second nature to me, not because I am a woman, but because I am me. It is a seamless part of my identity that I can not divorce from other parts of my life. I crave a partner, a companion, like most of the world. I want to fall in love with a man who would be willing to move to another city/state/country for my career. I want to be involved with a man who is my best friend and loves me because of my flaws and not in spite of them.  The hard part about contemplating issues, such as this one, over which I have no control is that I am afraid of the hard, realistic possibility that I may never find this individual. However, I have faith that things will follow the path that they are meant to travel. In the meantime, I am going to take a deep breath and focus on taking life one day at a time. There are days when I feel as new to the experience of living as a newborn child. Those moments often seem so simple that I am certain that I am missing a bigger lesson. Like a speeding car, it passes me by and leaves me standing, searching, on some lonely dirt road called life.  Introspection, as wonderful as it is, can be a dangerous thing. Thinking too much and too hard about a particular topic will wear you down, emotionally and mentally, and leave you more confused than when you began your ponderings. I think that Pooh had it right all along; life, and all the tiny moments that comprise it, just  is , not this insatiable push for progress that the human race seems hell bent on completing.  Right now, I am studying for a final exam, writing a paper, and trying not to pull out every single strand of my hair. Right now, I am learning to sit back, relax, and breathe. The world may not revolve around me, but it will wait on me for a little while. I think that men, when they are first introduced to me, forget that I am a woman. It is easy for them to see me as the embodiment of a label, a definition. They think that they know everything there is to know about my life, because I call myself a feminist. Assumptions get made at the drop of a hat; I am most definately a man-hater, I am probably a lesbian, and it is incredibly suspect that I have a good, healthy relationship with my father.  If I were to place an open advertisement for a life-partner, it would read  single, open-minded, slightly-dorky, academic-type woman seeks single, open-minded, funny man for a life-long commitment, which will include evenings of intellectual ramblings on feminist theory, very bad cooking, obsessive devotion to the art of shagging, cat hair that covers every conceivable surface, eventual birth of children, a house by the sea, and a woman who will stand by your side, no matter what life throws at you.I am too honest for my own good. Most women hide those dark parts, waiting for the moment to reveal thier true nature. I do not live my life in such a manipulative fashion, chosing instead to be completely honest and open about who I am as a woman, for better and for worse. I do not believe in the artificial and it is that dislike for artifice that creates my disdain for dating. In my mind, in my experience, dating is fake.  I do not want a romantic illusion, I want a real person in my life, to share my life. I want someone who forgets to leave the toilet seat down and can laugh at his own mistakes and weaknesses. I want a man who thinks that I am beautiful without make-up and who understands that kissing is not a prelude to sex, but a pleasure that is to be explored and enjoyed on its own merit. I want someone who will not run out the door, but will chose to stay by my side the morning after we have made love.  I want passion, truth, and someone who is not afraid to love me. Most of all, I want a man who understands that I am a strong-willed, take-charge, opinionated, refuse-to-be-a-doormate type of person; however, at the end of the day, I want to come home and have someone take care of me.  In a word, I want  acceptance . I believe in things that I cannot see with my eyes. I hold stock, importance and prominence, in the rest of the senses; touch, taste, hear, and smell. Yesterday, I celebrated the birth of a miraculous man. I cannot prove that he was the son of Godde, but I feel that particular truth down in the depths of my bones. However, he is not the only truth in which I believe nor does my belief in him negate or make impossible the existence of other esteemable tenants.  I consider myself a Celtic-Christo-Episco-Pagan, who follows the teachings of Jesus and pays homage to the Goddess. I believe in the existence of faeries, Santa Claus, elves, unicorns; all forms of magic that can only be found by paying attention, by listening to that child-like voice that lives inside of me, a voice that has the potential to disappear if we, human beings, do not guard it with care and love. I hold the words of Buddha close to my heart and I have a penchant for Islamic spiritual poetry. I follow the religious path of the ancient Celtic Church. I use my rosary for prayer and meditation.  I believe that evil exists, but I also believe in the overwhelming nature of Good, of Godde. Godde speaks to every man and woman, through every race, religion, and creed. Godde is not reserved for one nation or one brand of theology, but embraces and can be embraced by all who walk this planet. Beauty, happiness and fulfillment, can be found in every tradition.  Regardless of your path, I wish you a Blessed Christmas and a Happy New Year. There are some occasions for which Hallmark has no appropriate card to give to another human being. There is no card that expresses a proper sentiment for the friend who has been laid off from work for the second time in three years, for the woman who choses to have an abortion and struggles with that decision for the rest of her life, or for the man who is diagnosed with HIV and is forced to reconcile himself with the fact that he is dying.  There is no card for my friend, and co-worker, Nancy who was diagnosed with cancer and has spent the last three years battling this disease. Last week, I discovered that her doctor found four tumors in Nancy\\'s brain and that her chances of living to see another year are very slim. I am struggling with the injustice of this revelation. It is times like these that cause me to question Godde\\'s purpose for people. Is this kind of action the definition of mercy? Is it right for a woman, an individual who has never been anything but wonderful to her co-workers and friends, to suffer in such a manner? How does a person live out the remainder of their life, knowing that with each rotation of the sun they are one day closer to leaving behind all that they have ever known?  Sometimes, there are simply no words for the moment, no words to describe the shock you feel at learning that a person in your life will no longer be there to grace you with their smile. There are no words for the sadness, the frustration, and the anger that is felt when good people are forced to suffer and carry an unbearable burden, while the dregs of humanity walk the world and feel no consequences for their actions.  This is the hardest part about being a person of faith, not the theology that you adhere to nor the manner in which you daily practice the rituals of your religion, but the need to keep your hand tight around the tenuous thread of hope. The most difficult thing in the world is to have faith when the entire world tries to pull you away from it. I wait for the Red, red - the flow that marks me as a woman.Crimson guilt Of sins once done, Committed In a brazen act Of passion.Once more, I pay the price Of using my body To speak the language of liberation.When did the faerie dust disappear? Did my mother Put Away My favorite doll?I remember a simpler time, Before the Red Sea (with all its glorious might) Swept away my body Leaving my soul in her wake.This is a moment That belongs to Every Woman.A scare, A lunar flow unshed, A potential choice that devastates, And a false line that burns Bright pink.Hope lies in a cardboard box. Feminism is like any other ideology. It shifts, morphs, over time and different people interpret the ideology in a plethora of ways.  For me, feminism is mother\\'s milk, a liquid that runs through my veins and becomes one with my life\\'s blood.  I am unable to separate my affiliation with feminism from the rest of my life.  It is part of my DNA to be a strong woman, but every now and then I forget that I have that strength and fortitude.  I neglect that part of myself that can conquer the world, that will be an individual.  I am having a revival of my political alignment.  In the last few weeks, I have struggled with what it means to be a Christian and a feminist, my weight and self-worth issues, and sexual harrassment in the workplace.  Yesterday, I realized that I had been living my life in a vacuum, head buried under sand, letting events and opportunities pass me by without second glance.  Ani DiFranco sings that,  us people are just poems / we\\'re 90% metaphor / with a leanness of meaning / approaching hyper-distillation / and once upon a time / we were moonshine .  Once upon a time, we were pure, rid of societal impurity.  I want to reclaim that fierceness, that independence of mind and self once more.  I want to recover my strength from the terror that I experienced on the morning of yesterday.  No longer will I be claustrophobic, held back from the world for fear of making mistakes and disappointing other people in my life.  I want to eat, sleep, drink, fuck and breathe feminism through my pores.  This may no make sense to you, those individuals in cyberspace who know nothing about me but for the words that I write.  This may seem a jumble, a hodge-podge of vernacular guaranteed to confuse the mind and cause the heart to twist and turn.  It is none of these things and all of these things at once.  This is a statement.  This is a manifesto.  I am a woman who believes, who lives her life under the concept, that feminism can and will free men and women.  I am a white, anglophile, heterosexual, woman-loving, socially-liberal, fiscally-responsible, pro-choice, veggie-tree-hugger, rockin\\' mama, intellectual, believer in fae feminist.  No longer will I feel as if I am less of a woman, because I expect more from men; more being equality, respect, love, friendship, lust, and decency.  After all, would you expect any less of a poem?Procrastination, to be sure, is an artform. It is one that I have cultivated through many years of school, secondary and post-secondary education. There are days when it seems that I will never be motivated enough to pursue academia and then there are moments where it feels as though I am meant to be nothing but an academic, that scholarship and research will be my life.The hard part about going to graduate school on a part-time basis is finding the time to live. When you are an undergraduate student, your job is school and your life is a separate entity. When you work for a living and go to school at night, school, suddenly, becomes your life. All other aspects of daily living fall by the wayside and you are plunged into a monotonous routine of work and school, work and school, work and school.Procrastination, as a result, becomes more than an artform. It becomes as essential to life and breathing air and drinking water. It becomes sex, something that we do not need to survive, but is something that we cannot imagine living without.Therefore, one could conclude, procrastination is nothing short of fucking with our own self.I am having a hard time making decisions lately. This summer semester has been really difficult for me to get through. For some reason, I am not liking school as much as I thought I would. Truth be told, I hate writing papers and sitting through hours of class lectures. I am not sure if this is a phase, but more and more I am beginning to believe that I am not cut out for academia. I want to teach. I want a classroom. I want a life outside of publishing and research. I am so bloody sick of writing about women, gender, and feminism. To think that I wanted, thought that I wanted, to study this material for the rest of my life. I love being a feminist, but I hate writing about it. I hate the theory behind it. I want to be a practicing feminist, not a stuff academic one.  There are times where it seems that I am not meant to be anything but an academic, then I start thinking about all the years of school that I have left in store for me. At best, I will complete school by thirty-three. Not old at all, but do I want to be in school for that long? I am not sure. Right now, I just want to get through this fucking semester.  So small and fearless My fickle heart,  My brave path, My one true love.  A list of sins Follow inmy wake, Trailing afterme.  Give me amnesty, Sophia. Protect my mourning soul And comfort my love-starved self.  I cling to you. I pine for your presence, Godde. Waiting anxiously for the taste of your salvation upon my lips.  I imagine salvation tastes - like honey. - like green tea and jasmine.  -like salt licked from a man\\'s post-coital, sweat-soaked back. I imagine salvation tastes Wonderful.  Who do I have to fear In this colourful (colour-stained) world?  What pagan soul have I unravelled With my Jesus-freak sensibilities?  In a woman\\'s arms, Your arms, I wish to lie.  You seem like grace incarnate to me.  Godde is manifest. Not unreachable. Eager to be traced.  The small of a woman\\'s back, (the gateway to the womb) The curve of her neck (the matching pulse point of life) Laying shallow into the valley Of her breasts (the center of her heart).  Godde pulses, sweats, and breathes Alive in us all. ',\n",

This is an awesome video of an experiment showing  urlLink sand acting as a liquid  Some really powerful photos of gang lives take by  urlLink Robert Yager.urlLink Canon Announces the XL2  Need we say more.  I\\'ve been craving an XL since the first XL1.  Now the XL2, though I still want a  urlLink Panasonic AG-DVX100A .  Guess I just want it all  Test post.  I\\'ve seen this before, i mean it\\'s a must it\\'s a freaking DREAMCAST, they stopped making those in like 1998 before they even knew they were making them, in any case my fetish  urlLink grows.Isamu Sawada is an amazing designer.  I wonder if he does design as a profession or simply in his spare time.  I must say i only have mixed feelings about his  urlLink PowerfulBook R6 concept.  Still more amazing then anything i could do.  I always wondered why i didn\\'t make more friends over the telephone now i  urlLink know.I love aerial photography.  I think it just reveals so much about our cultures and what we find central and how we organize our living environments as a whole around each other.  I guess that\\'s why it\\'s a definite that i\\'m picking up  urlLink this book.My addictiong to  urlLink Hello, Kitty  branded computing merchandise continues to grow.  Wow if  urlLink this is true.I maybe almost required to get one.  I truly think it\\'s a dumb idea, i mean come on a game phone.  But i do give them props for certain things like bluetooth wireless gaming.  I mean that seems like such a simple no brainer to me.  Oh well, granted even if i got one it\\'s not like i\\'d have anyone to play wireless with.  This is a decent  urlLink Headset Roundup Review (MobileBurn) , though for some reason i was under the impression that it was every current bluetooth headset out there.  Still quite nice, as i keep searching for the bluetooth headset that i\\'m gonna get next...after i get a bluetooth phone that is.  A great article on the evolution of the Mac OS  urlLink help system. Perfect description  urlLink William GibsonOk.  So maybe i\\'m not enough a programmer/developer to understand this, but i have to rant.  WHY OH WHY, do vendors make \"simulators\" for their hardware products in Java, only to have them only run in windows?!?  They go on and on and on how it\\'s java based and the silulator is written in java as well, shouldn\\'t that mean it can be recompiled for Linux, Mac, etc?!  Argh I must say i truly love my sidekick.  The software is well integrated and the device is a decent size.  The problem is i\\'ve been unhappy with the way  urlLink T-Mobile  has been handling the device and it\\'s service specific to it.  There has been a decent amount of hub-bub around  urlLink Danger\\'s  newest incarnation of the device, but no really good pics of it, until  urlLink now  at least.  Though i must say i\\'m noot sure what i\\'ll do when it\\'s time to replace my sidekick, if i\\'ll upgrade to the newest hiptop, or something else.  I do know one thing, i am not a fan of the  urlLink Treo 600 , like everyone else seems to be.  Perhaps i\\'ll look into a  urlLink blackberry  and get a separate cell phone for voice.  I\\'d been considering that with my Hiptop for quite sometime now, just can\\'t justify it since i rarely use the phone aspect of it.  Anyone have any suggestions i\\'d love to hear them.  I thought i was a fanatic for notebooks and pens.  I carry 2-3 pens with me and a pencil and erase with me at all times.  Not to mention 2-3 notebooks for various ideas and categories of notes.  I must say though my pens have slowly been dying out since graduation i\\'ve been putting off getting knew pens till  urlLink now .  With that article i know what pens i should get and fill my bag and draw up again.  Following closely on the heals of WiFiFoFum, which allowed a user to see relative position of base stations on a \"radar screen\" of a WiFi equipped PocketPC.  Now comes  urlLink Open Source Virtual GPS for Wi-Fi.Continuing in the veign of cool gadgets, gizmos and Hello Kitty Merchandise.  I present to you:  urlLink FJ!!\\'s Pink Hello Kitty LaptopWell I\\'m certainly behind on the news.  Apparently  urlLink SubEthaEdit  V2.0 was release a couple days ago, I didn\\'t even realize it.  Also looks like they added all the improvements i wanted into it: code completion, line numbering always on, and new window size setting.  In case you don\\'t know the coolest feature of SubEthaEdit is the fact that it allows writers(code, document, etc) to collaborate together using rendezvous.  I\\'m very much stoked.  So rush out and get it.  Oh best part is it\\'s free.  I don\\'t have a PocketPC but i keep getting twinges to buy one simply from my gadget addiction kicking in.  That and the fact i don\\'t have one and never used one for extended ammount of time so i can\\'t realize i\\'d use it as much as my half a dozen Palm Pilots i have laying about.  Then i discover apps like,  urlLink WiFiFoFum , which kicks my gadget addiction, specifically the PocketPC vein into high gear.  Hopefully the craziness over the iPod Mini will finally subside with news of  urlLink this  coming out.  I meant to post this a day or two ago but totally forgot oops.  This is the kind of stuff that really pisses me off about big business, specifically the RIAA and MPAA:  urlLink Slashdot | RIAA Loss Report Contradicts Nielsen Sales Record urlLink Women in Gaming  is a great insight into why \"gaming for women\" fails.  As i\\'ve been saying for years, if you want to understand why it\\'s failing -- asking women will usually generate the proper response.  Unfortunately business and gaming companies usually end up with  urlLink this.Oh and a side note(being a complete chauvinistic pig to boot) the author is amazingly hot, Stevie Case at least, i can\\'t state how Alice looks as there is only a sketchIt\\'s projects like  urlLink this origami folding robot , that make me realize, i don\\'t have as much of a head for 3D and robotics as i think i do.  It\\'s just amazing stuff, all the different concepts that need to be mastered in order to make such a device.  This  urlLink blog entry  is a perfect example of why i blog and why i feel blogging is important.  It\\'s not about \"stating\" something as fact.  It\\'s about posting commentary on the world around us and quite often asking for feedback from the community.  I know in past blogs i\\'ve ran i\\'ve asked questions as many times as i\\'ve posted pure commentary.  I think it\\'s just a new idea in media, and it will take time for people to understand exactly WHY it\\'s different the past forms.  I must say, as a gamer and gadget freak, i\\'m very saddened by the lack of \"cool stuff\" that America has compared to all the amazingly cool (and mostly useless) stuff Japan has.  I mean i can finally get  urlLink a Hello Kitty memory card for the PS2 ,  urlLink Metal Gear Gamecube Bundle Pack .  It\\'s all only via import.  Come on guys get with it and bring us cool limited editions.  Americans are RIPE for the what seems like the Japanese tradition of owning multiple copies of consoles.  I mean if they brought that gamecube to the US i\\'d definitely buy a second one.  I\\'d soo buy a  urlLink FFXI  special edition PS2.  Oh well i just have to be patient and vote w/ my money when i can.urlLink Stilettos and Starbucks  Man why didn\\'t i call my blog THAT.  I wonder if i could fit this in my new apartment,  urlLink Petabox: a 1,000 terabyte array i thought i was being hardcore with my dream rack of XServe RAIDs.  I just found 2 words that probably could be used to describe me.  The first i guess is a good connotation to it.  The second seems like it could be used in both good and bad connotations:  urlLink The Word Spy - technosexualurlLink The Word Spy - geekeratiOh gawd, now we\\'re going to have PC users saying no wonder Macs suck look how slow they run on my emulator. urlLink Mac Rumors: PearPC - PowerPC/Mac OS X Emulation on a PC urlLink Neural.it: English content.Ahh the days of an EMAC student rush through my memory while at this site.  Makes me remember why i hated the program and refuse to become an \"artist\".  The new version of playfair,  urlLink hymn -- Hear Your Music aNywhere  which cracks the DRM on tunes purchased from iTunes, but doesn\\'t strip your Unique ID from the file.  I feel this is the best anti DRM software yet.  DRM is a touchy subject and it\\'s still in the process of finding the \"right path\".  So having tools like this is handy in case said DRM style becomes antiquated.  Though in the end you are still breaking the licensing agreement/law.urlLink  Fresh Air: Bill O\\'Reilly Interview .  He doesn\\'t want us to here parts of this interview so of course i need to blog about it and let everyone know to listen to the interview and pass on the fact that he doesn\\'t want people to hear it.  Wow the new Blogger is really quite sexy.  I must say i didn\\'t think that Blogger could get much better, but this is definitely much better.  i need to get  urlLink Anthony Hamilton\\'s  music.  His music has a real nice sound.  To bad i can\\'t find the link i\\'ve used to make iTMS links.  Oh well, you will know how to find the album i\\'m sure.  EDIT: Oops forgot  urlLink Los Lonely BoysEDIT: Oops forgot to publish haha but as you can see i re-found the link to format iTMS links again.  Much like cars, some people just shouldn\\'t be allowed to use computers.  Continuing in my pirate radio vein:  urlLink iPod pirate radio bumper stickers .  Not sure how much the FCC would like these but eh, stick it to the man.  Sorry that was horrible but i couldn\\'t help it.  So it looks like my post yesterday about needing being able to make a pocket size radio station has been answered with a  urlLink DIY iTrip Amplifier .  I mean yea we could just broadcast with an iTrip but that\\'s only like 20-30 feet if lucky.  So this is a welcome addition to the collection.urlLink How-To Tuesday: Make your own Pirate Radio Station with an iPod  Reminds me of my frosh year at RPI when we made a pirate radio stationg that blanketed freshman hill.  The fact there is a possibility to make a pocket size pirate radio station is awesome.  I\\'m very much for low power pirate radio stations, ahh the good ol\\' days.  I don\\'t want one, I NEED  urlLink one .  No seriously, please i\\'m a sucker for old school film tech.  I have an old school 8MM and i\\'d have probably half a dozen or more if i still went to yard sales and flea markets like i used to when i was a kid.  The fact i can actually have the look and feel of old film tech and digital internals just makes me more excited then is reasonably expected.  Ok this is quite old but supposedly people have  urlLink the real dirt on Appleâ\\x80\\x99s Cinema Displays?While the sizes seem about right as well as the resolutions there are a couple of things that common sense just state don\\'t work.  First of all, switching from the ADC(Apple Display Connector) to DVI.  I think Apple really likes be slick and having as few wires as possible.  With dropping ADC you lose Video, Power and USB all in one cable.  So you would go from 1 cable to 3 cables.  Which brings me to my next point, they state there will be 2 firewire ports on it.  How is this possible since ADC doesn\\'t carry firewire signal and if they do go with DVI there would be neither USB or Firewire.  So now that\\'s 4 wires coming out of this display.  Bleh i wouldn\\'t mind many of these features but just don\\'t see it happening.  Sadly right before my switch over, i as well suffered from the delussion that I could  urlLink turn my PC into a Mac .  As the expression goes the interface is just skin deep.  You don\\'t get the true OS X experience.  Well perhaps you can now, as when i did this it was 3 years ago, and the software on the market to do these things was new and buggy.  Still interesting to see, i wonder what the psychological aspects of all this are.  Perhaps there aren\\'t any haha.  I have dreams about having an army of robotic artist minions to do my bidding as an artist.  For i seem to think on a more conceptual level and not really good at that whole \"creating\" bit.  I can think of cool idea but horrible at making content.  Just all about remixing and re-manifesting previous art into my new pieces and now i almost can have my dream with,  urlLink Project K .  So just need more machines making abstract automatic art, preferably which changes over time so that i can incorporate them into my video. Mmmmm robotic artists...  It\\'s days like today that i\\'m still amazed by Apple Computers.  There is all this press about a few pictures of a \"new\"/\"upgraded\" g5 that have been leaked, or photoshoped.  Whatever the case may be.  Then they release the  urlLink AirPort Express .  I think several times more amazing then an upgraded G5 will ever be.  I mean i\\'m looking forward to a bump since i\\'m in the market for a  urlLink mid range g5  and  urlLink mid range screen .  The fact that they made a complete base station alittle larger then there current powerbricks AND added  urlLink features  to it, just blows me away.  Keep it up Apple and keep me amazed.  So it looks like the web-utility i use to make the beautiful  urlLink Amazon Links  is offline, hopefully it will be back up soon, but just for record i\\'m now read  urlLink Angels  Demons  and still playing Rainbow Six, though i did pick up  urlLink Full Spectrum Warrior  i haven\\'t had much free time to play it.  Oh by the way, show you how busy i was yestarday.  I TOTALLY missed my favorite  urlLink OSes  b-day.  Yestarday marked  urlLink Ten Years of BeOS (coverage via slashdot).  So i was just thinking about sharing tunes via  urlLink rendezvous and wireless networks .  When i realized well i only carry my tunes via my iPod making it useless in this system, then i was like why can\\'t i hook it up to the USB port on the Pocket PC.  Nope, USB is a Master/Slave relationship not Peer-to-Peer like Firewire.  Luckily  urlLink a USB host Compact Flash card  is soon to be released.  Then i realized between USB 1.1 speed, the speed of wireless, and PocketPC speed, this would be gawd awful slow, i still think it would be worthwhile to tinker around with.  I guess i\\'ll still look forward to a company to actually incorporate this sort of sharing into the Mp3 Player of choice for me.  Thank you,  urlLink Engadget  for making my day with this choice quote: \"Most people still have absolutely no idea what in the hell weâ\\x80\\x99re talking about when we bring up Voice over IP (which is why weâ\\x80\\x99ve long since abandoned it as a pickup line).\"  It\\'s the simple things in life right?

Though i\\'ll probably post rough pics of what it looks like with what little stuff i have in my apartment then a \"finalized\" version in about a month when i get the last of my furniture ordered and arrived.  Moving into my first apartment alone you realize how many \"holes\" you have in personal possessions as roommates seem to offset the need for owning everything.  But i\\'m excited as i get to order my sofa and bed this week.  Left to get: 2 Desks and Dining Room chairs.  This is a pretty boring post but just an update why i haven\\'t posted anything in SOOO long.  Oh and happy 4th of july by the way.  I need more time in the day where i can just sit and blog all the crap that i come in contact with.  Hopefully when my job application for Millionaire goes through that will be a side job i can pick up.  Ok i haven\\'t posted in a while.  I haven\\'t fled the country or locked up or anything bad, just settling into my new apartment and working hard.  So no time to dork out, plus no really comfy spots in my house yet as i don\\'t have a real bed or couches yet, to dork out in.  So not to worry i\\'ll be back soon.  I sooo need one of  urlLink THESE  it\\'s not even funny and it\\'s only $229 to boot.  Not to mention it comes with Toast 6 Titanium which is a $99 in and of itself!!  Ahh i need more money.  Wonder if Apple will make the leap and make dual layer media.  Here\\'s to hoping.',\n",
              " 'Every day should be a half day.  Took the afternoon off to hit the dentist, and while I was out I managed to get my oil changed, too.  Remember that business with my car dealership this winter?  Well, consider this the epilogue.  The friendly fellas at the Valvoline Instant Oil Change on Snelling were nice enough to notice that my dipstick was broken, and the metal piece was too far down in its little dipstick tube to pull out.  Looks like I\\'m going to need a magnet.Damn you, Kline Nissan, daaaaaaammmnnn yooouuuu....Today I let my boss know that I\\'ve submitted my Corps application.  The news has been greeted by everyone in the company with a level of enthusiasm that really floors me.  The back deck has finally been cleared off by the construction company working on the place.  This company, for anyone who\\'s interested, consists mainly of one guy who spends his days cursing at his crew of Spanish-speaking laborers.  Construction of my deck began around the time Nixon was getting out of office.  Consider the ball rolling.  I\\'ve submitted my application and health review, and I\\'ve made myself available for assignment starting March 2005.  I\\'m going to be back in the office environment again starting Thursday.  Cry for me.  Oh well, I think hitting the submit button on my application tomorrow might actually make that return bearable.  I\\'m still not making any headway with my family.  In fact, I think Mom has been rallying the troops (aka aunts and uncles) against me.  Meanwhile, my friends have been really supportive of the idea.  Thanks, all.  It\\'s frustrating, you know?  Here, I want to get out into the world, have a pinch of adventure, and maybe help some people out in the process, and I\\'m earning the resentment of the entire freakin\\' family because of this.  I can only hope that, over time, cooler heads will prevail.  There\\'s now a nationwide girlfriend hunt on for yours truly (hell, with Mom\\'s Mexico ties, this shit could go international), because, obviously, the cure for all this foolishness is for me to get laid.  Oh, and I should buy myself something nice.  Problem solved.  Life is so sad.  Had a spot of Sunday night insomnia, fueled mostly by my discussions with the parents yesterday.  Thankfully, Jack Daniels helped me out with that.  Whoever is in charge of late night Sunday programming should be shot.  Sunday night insomnia is not an uncommon phenomenon, and TV needs to be there for people in their hour(s) of need!  Jerks.  Two points for anyone who can identify that bit of dialogue (one of my favorite bits).  Hint: Director Steven Soderbergh insists that it\\'s meaningless.  Back to  About Schmidt  for a moment.  I just love the name Schmidt.  Does anyone else feel the same way?  So many superfluous letters... that kooky \"c\"... that silent \"d\".  Along those same lines: it took Michael Moore to really help me memorize the spelling of \"Fahrenheit\".  Yes, I\\'m still adhering to my own rule that periods don\\'t need to go inside quotation marks.  The parents are on their way out.  I\\'m going to try to think of something to cook, lest we end up at Axl\\'s Bonfire Grill down the street.  Let me see... corn on the cob fresh from my grimy stove-top, or perhaps a nice walleye salad at Axl\\'s?  Decisions, decisions.About Schmidt  this afternoon.  Pretty good.  A little vexed by the ending.  I think I\\'m getting too lazy to interpret ambiguity.  Finished up most of my application today, essay questions and all.  All that remains is to inform my references of their reference status... and that could very well mean letting my company know that I\\'m planning to leave in 6 mos. to a year.  I\\'m not sure how they\\'ll react, but I\\'m not all that concerned, either.  Good people there, certainly, but I am giving them at least  six months  notice.  At this point, the only thing that gives me pause is Sydney.  I have to make sure she has a home for a few years, and I have to be sure that whoever gets her knows what they\\'re getting into.  Sydney\\'s a good cat in a lot of ways... very clean, very well mannered, sweet as all get out... and that tiny meow.  That said, she likes to scratch stuff, and I should probably get that in check before I expose her to furniture that isn\\'t dorm-rated.  I spent a good hour last night paging through the application and making little notes about what to say for the longer, essay portions.  The questions being asked are standard job interview stuff, at least they were at the University.  Basically, how do you handle diversity, and why do you want to work here?  As for the short answers: I haven\\'t decided whether I should be concerned by the fact that there\\'s an entire page dedicated to previous volunteer experience... and, apart from a pledge that I\\'m going to be doing some tutoring work for the Minnesota Literacy Council, that page is going to be completely blank.  The job history page says to go back \"at least 10 years.\"  Ten years ago, I was 16.  I was working at Best Buy, and I hated it.  I should note, though, that I saw my old manager working at Audio King (back when it was called Audio King), many months ago.  Then there was Media Play... then Hollywood Video... I can\\'t believe that an international aid organization would find my ability to upsell Packard Bells, or say in what section  Femalien  resides, remotely interesting.  How I spent the remainder of my Thursday night: Watched  The Fog of War , an amazing Errol Morris doc about Robert McNamara.  Then, I went to sleep and had strange dreams involving Holly Hunter.  It\\'s pretty obvious that I\\'m not a great learner of lessons, because here I am writing the umpteeth \"first blog entry\" of my life.  Someone, somewhere (probably pretty close to here, actually), is going to open up this domain expecting to see handsome video game Cratchit digging his way out of a sand trap, only to find I\\'m on the blogging track again.  Cue blood squib explosions and the first movement of Carmina Burana.  But, wait.  I\\'m a changed man, baby!  Things will be different this time, I swear!  Well, maybe not right away, but eventually, I hope.  I\\'ve been feeling more than a little anxious the past few months.  Life as a web developer has sort of burned me out, and I think I\\'d like to try something different... something that will get me closer the Great Life Goal I\\'m shooting for.  I\\'m not sure what the Goal is exactly, but I get the feeling I\\'ll never get there on my current course.  Web development is great and all, but sometimes I get the impression that, in this field, I\\'m driven more by my perfectionism than by any genuine love of the work.  It\\'s no secret to anyone that\\'s spoken to me in the past few months that I\\'m about this (--) close to joining the Peace Corps.  In fact, the application is sitting on my coffee table right now.  There\\'s a pen there, too.  Oh, and I\\'ve filled in a few blanks with that very same pen.  There are a few very big blanks that are going to demand more brainpower than I can muster after 8-something hours of mind-numbing development, but I promise you that I\\'m going to power through and get all 16+ pages of the form in the mail by the end of next week.  I\\'m sure even my fans in Chicago will be able to hear my mother\\'s cries when she hears the news.  So, you see, this blog has a reason for existing.  I\\'m hitting the reset button on life, and you\\'re all going to be here to see it.  Dramatic, right?  Anyway, here we go.  My reference forms trickled in last week, and that left the weekend for me to buck up my cross-cultural adaptation essay, something I\\'ve been really struggling with.  What\\'s a significant experience  you\\'ve  had with adapting to a different culture?  You\\'d think that a three month stint in Europe would make a question of this kind really easy to answer, but it doesn\\'t... tourism, as it turns out, doesn\\'t really lend itself to forcing you adapt to anything other than washing your clothes in a sink.  I wish I could say I\\'ve needed to wipe my butt with a leaf once in my life, but that\\'s just not the case... hence, my application to the PC. Back to the story, then.  I filled up the huge PC envelope last night and sent it on its way this morning.  There\\'s an education addendum that I decided against filling out, only because it would have been a pretty pathetic-looking effort.  My IT addendum, on the other hand, was five pages long.  Huzzah!  I\\'d still rather not spend two years sitting in front of a computer in Whateverstan, but I don\\'t want to limit my placement opportunities, either. So that\\'s that.  Now I wait for a nomination. On the \\'rents:  This weekend, I told them that I\\'ve submitted my application and met with a recruiter.  Their heads didn\\'t explode.  They didn\\'t key my car or light my hair on fire.  Still, Dad says that I\\'m making a mistake, and Mom said she wouldn\\'t be able to sleep.  I stressed the importance of optimism, as opposed to--well, you know--flipped-out, irrational fatalism. DNC:  Politics.  Feh.  Here\\'s my take on politics:Dear Republicans:  George W. Bush...  This is the best you\\'ve got?  Are you fucking serious?  Dear Democrats:  John Kerry...  This is the best you\\'ve got?  Are you fucking serious?  That is all.  You may return to your regular business.Hey, I gave you guys a little vacation.  Hope you enjoyed it. Met with my Peace Corps recruiter Friday afternoon at the PC office above Kieran\\'s. Answered a bunch of those types of questions you get at job interviewsm, and was fingerprinted for my soon-to-be-generated FBI file. There goes my backup plan of becoming a jewel thief. Managed to skirt around conversation relating to this on Sunday, when I visited the parents. Actually, I haven\\'t yet told them that I\\'ve actually started the application process, only that I\\'ve been thinking seriously about it. I probably would have gotten into it, but Mom called me on Thursday afternoon, loaded up with a bunch of anecdotes from the \"Casualties of Peace\" series of articles that ran in the Dayton Daily News last year. Arguing with your mother is a good way to ruin your lunch break, and many of the hours thereafter. But I really should be going. Hoping to get the rest of my paperwork in this week. After that, I\\'ll ready myself for a series of invasive medical check-ups. Joy!My parents have the week off work... so when the weekends just aren\\'t enough time to argue about my decisions, now I can do that on Thursday mornings, too!  Something about social circles, I guess: my parents insist that everyone they talk to about my future excursion rolls their eyes at the idea, throws their hands up in the air and cries \"Why?!\"  Perhaps they exaggerate.  My mother is a veritable encyclopedia of horror stories about international travel.  \"Didn\\'t you hear about those people in Honduras two years ago that were tortured and killed?\"  \"Didn\\'t you hear about that couple in Mexico that they put in jail and wanted $10,000 from?  And the wife had appendicitis.  And then Satan bit their arms off, and smuggled them over the border... stuffed with cocaine!\"  \"You don\\'t want to go to Africa!  They have apartheid, and they like to kill white people!\"  [rolls eyes]  A recruiter called today, and I\\'m all set up to interview/be fingerprinted next Friday afternoon.  The recruiter also wants to flesh out one of my essay responses.  I wasn\\'t altogether happy with my essays.  Like I\\'ve said before, my capacity for churning out long form answers that are semi-coherent has been damaged by one too many English classes over the years.  More often than not, I come off sounding like a damn moron... or maybe I always sounded that way, and all of those English classes just helped me to recognize my own moronitude.  Setback: I called today to register for ESL pre-training classes, but it turns out they were completely full for the month.  OK.  August, then.  Now I won\\'t be able to sit down and actually tutor anyone until sometime in September.  Too many do-gooders in this world, I tell you.  This weekend: Friday, I did very little.  Saturday, I tried to see the Grand Excursion, but the boats were late, and it started to rain.  Plus, I didn\\'t care.  Jer and I hooked up PSX controllers to the computer and played some old arcade games via MAME.  You know MAME, right?  Of course you do.  Everyone comes back to MAME once a year to remember just how bad most of the games were they drooled over years ago.  Remember \"Narc\" and \"Bad Dudes\"?  Terrible, terrible games ( \"I\\'m bad!\" ).  \"Final Fight\" still seems decent, and thankfully shows that not  all  of those precious quarters were wasted.  Ahh, to be back in the K-mart arcade playing \"Altered Beast\" and \"Time Warriors\"...  Sunday, I sat around some more.  While everyone else was watching fireworks, I was sitting through \"Fahrenheit 9-11\".  In a nutshell: I loved the first ten minutes, including the minimalist title sequence, and the eerie handling of 9-11.  Moore\\'s naked contempt for G.W. is palatable when it\\'s merely being insinuated.  It\\'s less so when he refers to G.H.W. Bush as G.W.\\'s \"daddy\"... but then I guess that\\'s what political discourse has become in this country.  As with \"Bowling for Columbine\", Moore\\'s film is most effective when read at arm\\'s length.  Many of his facts are incorrect, and the things he infers can be completely unfair, but some of the broader strokes (such as our cozy relationship with Saudi Arabia, or the increased fear-mongering of the media in the past few years) invite discussion, which is probably a good thing.  Wild man Dan Nordquist has invited me to post on his new  urlLink video game blog .  See you there.  Got a big pack of PC forms in the mail yesterday, including a few for my fingerprints.  With luck, I\\'ll get an interview scheduled this week or next.  How are you doing?  I\\'m so happy to hear that!  Not feeling terribly motivated to get outside for some fireworks this evening.  I\\'ve been dead tired all day, to tell you the truth.  Spent some time out at my parents\\' place today, but Peace Corps didn\\'t make the meeting agenda, so the Big News will have to wait a week.  Signed up for Google News Alerts about the Peace Corps today, just to keep my eye on things.  Bleh, I can\\'t seem to eat anything that agrees with me these past few weeks.  I wonder if I have a parasite.  I received a short E-mail from the local PC recruiter this morning.  They\\'ve received my application, so I guess the online form works.  More forms on the way.  Sent a mail to the MLC last night to get signed up for their programs.  ESL tutor pre-training starts next Tuesday.  Marlon Brando died today. ',\n",
              " 'testing with each and every passing day its hard to imagine your going away... i still wake up every day cherishing your presence in a special way... no matter where i am or what i\\'m doing your always there in my heart... you never leave my mind, or eyes, i don\\'t even try it would be to hard....  each minute away seems like a whole day and a different place.... each hour is spent picturing your smile and your face.... each thought becomes physical, as i race to make it home.... excited to just see your face, not have to talk on the phone....  i realize when i walk through the door i\\'ve been dreaming all day.... your more beautiful than i could ever dream now that we\\'re face to face... as i wrap my arms around you and cherish we\\'re in the same place... alls i can think of is your passionate kiss, and how i\\'ve longed for its taste....  its time to relax now so we sit down and vent about our days... we talk about all we\\'ve done, and how we missed each others face.... we spend our evenings together whoever said they needed space.... we wrap around each other as we drift away to our dreams... i\\'m laying next to the only girl i want how bad can life be.....  to many this is boring and just seems like killing time.... to me this is heaven and just being with what is mine.... listening to her breathe in my ear, knowing just then shes fine.... we might be lame laying there all curled.... but i wouldn\\'t change a thing, i\\'m the happiest man in the world.... today was cool. i woke up this morning @ 9:30 and got dressed, just then i decided that salleh looked cold so i laid back in bed with her to keep her warm for a few more minutes... fast forward to 12:30... i woke up a second time... undressed took a shower .... then as i was leaving sally muttered... \"what about mcdonalds\" with her sleepy voice still sleeping in bed... she wanted some breakfast or lunch .... so i left here and went and got us some grub when  i got back we ate together and i left for work.  she stayed home and then at 4 went to work.... blah thats done now.  i went to work then went to my boy kewons house and hooked up a computer.... saw his pitbulls ... after all of that i drove home and on the way sally called me and wanted me to come up there and see her... so i did.  i had the smoke house chicken dinner... after i ate that i went and smoked a cigerette with her in the backroom where she said to me, \"if i get caught i\\'m getting fired..\" heh see what she will do for a cigerette with me? hahah i\\'d like to think it was because i was there but i just think she needed a cigerette... :P  anywho now i\\'m home .... and i went out and bought 8 things of red bull and a 5th of vodka... and her and i are going to drink and play match.... for the first time in a minute her and i are going to have our alone night and i\\'m like so looking forward to it.... a night where her and i can make each other laugh and giggle... then by the end of the night with all of those intoxicants inside of us we will be going to bed... or at least trying.... so this defintly could be a good night from what i see so far... i\\'m totally excited.... okay here she is.... haha complaining about my pop she carried in getting on her shirt.... UNTIL NEXT TIME.... PEACE so far today has been quite interesting.  i arrived at work to find that one of my loans was ready to be processed and closed, which means lots of money coming my way real quick.  then i got paid for another deal, sally came down to my office and we went to the bank together to deposit the check into our account.  she just now left to work from here and is working the majority of the evening most likely.  i think i\\'m gonna head home here in a bit, possibly go tanning on the way back... hmmmm ya know fuck it... i think i\\'m gonna have \\'steve time\\' and go ahead and do that shit. things have been really ..... stressful lately i\\'m not sure why but.... in the words of eminem... sometimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders everyones leaning on me.....  i\\'m gonna pull through and be victorious though... i mean fuck, i don\\'t have a choice.  i have people that are depending on me... so i have too. sometimes life just seems like it would be so much easier with out any obligations except for myself, but then i realize that easier is not always better... and sometimes when you have obligations they make you achieve more.... i wouldn\\'t trade my obligations for nothing.  my obligations are human and alive... and i love em both... but fuck... heh.... (peanut  salleh).  well fuck i better get out of here and get to the tanning salon before traffic gets crazy... so i\\'m on my way out.... peace! [ private entry ] i feel like shit.  blah.  don\\'t you hate when your back is against the wall... and you really can\\'t just ... BE FREEEEEEE for whatever reasons you have no choice but to be the way you are being.... quiet... secluded..... i don\\'t know... it\\'s just that i know people too well... and i can take hints even when they are not hints... its just someone talking.... but inadvertantly giving hints.... hints to me... what they really want... and thats.... not me there..... blah. *yawn* i apologize for the lack of updates, but you must excuse me for the procrastination.  things have been so fucking hectic as of lately it is almost even hard to imagine.  i\\'ve been going through some things that i\\'m finally coming to terms with and being able to accept and make the best of it, the last thing that has been on my mind is this website unfortunately. but things are starting to look better (dare i say it?), so hopefully i can continue my habit that i once had and keep posting here... i wish i could just vent and let you guys know what\\'s been going on .... but itsprivate  .  trust me... i would tell you if i thought there was a way. sally and i are great - i\\'m sure that is what you guys are immediately thinking .... no we are not broken up... she still lives here.... we are still together... and most importantly we are still happy :)  i guess my problems have just been **my** problems.... having a lot of \"reality checks\" and realizing i\\'m not where i want to be in life with this mortgage business - so i\\'m in the process now of trying to do something to change it... so that my work can accommodate my lifestyle that i will be having here shortly when i start school........  basically the world has just been stressful and the last thought on my head has been this site ;)  hope to be posting more now...  \"We don\\'t live in the world of reality, we live in the world of how we perceive reality.\"  Bryan Singer, director of \"The Usual Suspects\"today was interesting.  i really don\\'t know what too say about it... i woke up feeling good considering what i did to my body the night before with drinking, sally on the other hand hardly could pull herself out of the bed.  anywho the majority of the day i spent laying on the couch with sally pretty much telling one another our hopes dreams and regret for drinking as much the night before.so fuck i\\'m feeling wierd.  *sigh* i don\\'t even know where to start.  what happens when you cherish something so special, and it is only special because of something unique... i mean that is what makes it ... \"special\".  so what happens when you begin to see that vision of the unique quality in that special person changing beyond your control.  the person has several different qualities which make them so special, but this one quality almost defies the person to your heart.  possibly a quality that opens the door to your heart.  blah blah blah... i don\\'t know where i\\'m going with this... or if i even wanna go on with this.... but none the less ....  it boils down to the fact, that no matter what i\\'m feeling or why i\\'m feeling it.... even if it makes sense to me... i can\\'t react to it based on selfish reasons.....  but sometimes.... i just want to feel like... i\\'m worth a piece of sacrafice... because ... to me.... my special person is worth the ultimate sacrafice.. and if i would lay that down with out ever questioning a thing or think of being selfish... for something so little, why can\\'t i feel that way?  its selfish in its self... and blah .... blah .... blah.  i\\'m going now... its saturday night sally and i are getting ready to go over shawns house and drink play pool and more less get intoxicated again.  (begining to feel like an alchoholic).  none the less, last night we went down too ypsi and partied with sallys sister stephy... hmmm it was a really good time we ended up going to her frat friends party house and getting pretty drunk.... heh then when we woke up this morning (stayed the night out there) - and after the fact we decided that we would go to my buddy kewons house and look at his pit puppy that he wants to sell me... it is beautiful - then he offered to sell me a condo that he owns.... blah... heh been an interesting day.....  so yeah i think i\\'m gonna get going now... btw we posted the pictures of florida... just haven\\'t added them to the pictures page.... heh go check them out right here....  urlLink florida pictures  another day in the life of steve... last night i went and saw the movie \"passion of christ\".... what a powerful movie, didn\\'t expect that whatsoever.  everyone i have talked to that has seen the movie has said that they cried during the movie, well leaving the movie i was kind of scared not knowing why i didn\\'t cry... i mean i teared up on armagaddon... and not passion of the christ? am i the devil? nah heh it was the late show we went too and the mood that was overcasting the night.  none the less sally and i enjoyed the hell out of the movie. today i\\'m going to the gym after work (where i am right now) while sally i think is going to get her nails done.  thats about all that is going on right now.... so until something fun changes..... or something... or anything.... um.... peace. dear monday, i hate you. i always have. but i need you, and never have. it\\'s monday and here we are again, a new week that no one wants to experince.  i\\'m at work, after tearing myself apart from sally this morning who only wanted me to be there with her and not leave.... she sat by the window as i was leaving and made me feel bad.. it was cute - but then i had to convince her that we need money and i don\\'t make money by watching her put on make up... i wish i did... well who doesn\\'t.  so now i\\'m at work and i\\'m still waiting on my mom to get some paper work to me....this weekend sally and i just chilled, begining with friday night it was an early night - we both fell alsleep rather early ..... she worked all night.  saturday night we got really intoxicated and i really can\\'t recall much of saturday night because that is how drunk we were.  sunday we laid together on the couch and watched a documentary on tupac and biggie, then fell alsleep watching the oscars.  haha anywhoooooo.  last night i decided that i\\'m going to start a new corporation.  like an online mortgage loan officer.  it is still in the works of being planned and cordinated, but hopefully in the next few weeks i\\'m able to compile enough resources and information in order to get this put together.  this could only make me more money, by providing a central location where people can go and fill out an online loan application, recieve a user name and password, so that they are able to login at any time and check the status of the pending loan application - additionally any time a change happens with their loan application the system will email them and make the client aware of the changes.i am learning that advertising is such a complicated, yet simple task.  to advertise you are gambling.  you are putting a lot of assets into the marketing campaign with only hope and faith that there will be a profitable return from it.  *sigh*.  i hope that this works out for me...i guess you guys will be able to come along my journey in starting this and getting it off the ground..... oh yea and if you have any hints or advice.. you can share that too.... peace. as i pondered what today had to offer me i realized that i\\'m not even 100% positive as to what this day they call \"Memorial Day\" signifies.. so I did some research.  now today is a very very important day for many families in america, who have been unable to smell, speak, hear, touch, their loved ones due to loosing them in a war and as a former soldier myself i suppose that if i were to have ever died in combat that i would want to be remembered on more than one occasion a year (my birthday).  its sad really, as you drive up and down the streets, turn on your radio, this holiday has become more recognized for a \"4 day party\" than its intended meaning. am i guilty?  of course i\\'m guilty i attempted to party all weekend myself, but now as i sit here and reflect on things and try to remain perceptive into other peoples memorial day weekends, it almost saddens me to think of the family that has lost a love one in a war whether decades ago, or recently.  as they drive down the streets they see the weekend slumber and every one smiling having a great time enjoying their 4 day weekend - only wishing that they too could be doing the same thing sharing this weekend with the love one they lost.  as they turn on their radio to take away this haunting, disturbing, creepy feeling they are consumed with club and party promotions by the radio stations who are taking this weekend and its purpose and converting it into some sort of lucrative toss up to make some money as they promote a club. i\\'m lucky, that i\\'m able to celebrate this weekend and not have to reflect back on any one in particular that i\\'ve lost - but how unfortunate for those who do not share that same luck.  we raise our flags, start the grill, crack a beer and our weekend has started, the celebration, has started. we as a society have lost sight of the meaning of this weekend, and i just hope that one day possibly next year i can make my own first step towards actually making it... a memorial day...and reserving my celebration for the day that truly is intended for it, independence day.  cool quote i found:  \" Soldier, rest! Thy warfare o\\'er, Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking, Dream of battled fields no more. Days of danger, nights of waking. \"~Sir Walter Scottquote found @  urlLink memorial day memorial..- goodnight. well it\\'s been official... but today is the first official day i felt it.  i feel renewed.  the last several days have been some of the hardest days of my life...they\\'ve been hard.  but you know there are so many positive things that this new era in my life brings - and i\\'m just happy that this weekend a complete stranger was able to make all of these ill feelings go away.  it was almost like an angel from heaven sent down to serve the purpose of placing me back into reality and providing me with a positive outlook on things so that i\\'m able to cope, survive and pick back up.  just what i\\'m doing.  here is a random note: i smell her hair where ever i go.... i smell her skin where ever i go... sometimes the scent is so strong... i turn around and look for her....  so back to this weekend.  this complete stranger gave me strength, gave me so much in fact that i\\'m... dare i say ... eager to begin this new era?  heh.  i am going to try to keep this journal focused on me and my life... my feelings... and i suppose as the days pass so will the times i mention her name...its a bit harder for me than her... i guess she is.... stronger? *wink* .... anyways.. okay that\\'s my post... goodnight :)  and stranger... i know your reading this... so .... thank you again :)  - goodnight everyone and hope you had a good weekend :)  will post about mine ... tomorrow. ...and the words came from her mouth.  \"I can\\'t do this anymore\". It\\'s 11:21 pm and i\\'ve been in constant battle with this idea all night trying to encourage her to re-think it, and come up with some other solutions that seem a tad more practical and real.  after the perfect day we had this just seems that there was not enough thought put into it - i don\\'t know.. i haven\\'t even begun dealing with it yet because it hasn\\'t sit well in my stomach yet... its something rather new that i seem to be numb too at this point - but all hell will break loose when it becomes my reality and i\\'m forced to have to deal with it... this is something i dont want to have to deal with.. i wasn\\'t ready... is it really that hard for two people to be in love?  fuck. i would have never wished for any of this in a million years, the thought of it alone is repulsive.  yet in the same reality this has been such a positive boost for you and i - everything between us is seemingly improving, from our ambition too our love, to our sex life.  everything just is amazing right now yet pitiful at the same time.  i would love to go back to how we were doing simple things, living with one another and spending every waking hour with one another - yet would the \"spark\" die if such a thing were to ever happen again? do we get along better when we dont live with one another?  i don\\'t know... *sigh*.  i\\'m realizing ... we are realizing so many things with this distance between us now - things i think we needed to realize... i just wish they were things that could have been realized while we were living with one another.  who knows what the future holds for you and i - but one thing is for certain.. from the sound of it your not going anywhere - you love me to death and nothing is going to come inbetween that - nothing.  that would be \"shallow\" i believe was the word you used for it.  *(sigh)*tonight we watched the american idol finale and it was just amazing, could things have been more relaxing for you and i?  its pitiful i was so captivated by the moment of you and i laying together / sitting together / sitting on top of one another that i could hardly focus on the tv to watch the show.  then the songs that they were singing were just so ironic to the situation that you and i are facing right now... tonight was just so sureal.  -goodnight i\\'m tired of being confused its worse then being abused sometimes i feel like my mind is being used and other times i question the truth and its all because of you yet you too remain confused every day i feel like i\\'m a bomb about to explode and your my fuse but its not because you choose its because your family holds your hand and likes to emotionally abuse you into making choices its like making noises that ammuse you but after awhile they start to bruise you i wont let them win i wont loose you.i hate the fact i\\'m always being attacked yet i cant defend myself like i want i want to go crazy like i\\'m on crack they wont cut you any slack they always watch your back never let you choose for yourself i need some prozac they need to relax they need to stop cutting you down like a tree they need to drop their axe this reality of love not an act the more they keep fighting the more this will turn to another iraq i\\'ll declare war because i have nothing to loose except you and i want you more no matter how many walls they build i\\'ll walk through them and build a door our love will soar their my sore their germs on the floor heres some bleach burn like smores you\\'ll soon learn i\\'m not going away any time soon i\\'ll make this a chore.  you cant buy me or make me leave you cant beg me or force me i\\'m deaf to the word please i\\'m forever in your life let go now or your gonna be miserable when shes my wife because i\\'m not going anywhere i\\'m running wild like a crackhead with a knife cutting anything that gets in the way of my dream and my sight she is worth the fight in my darkest hour shes my light i\\'ll never let go i\\'ll hold on real tight i wont loosen my grip not even a might because im here for good im done being polite im done being nice im here for the win not your advice so kiss my ass and dream of our wedding each night we just want to be free and romantic nothing can stop us not even your finances...okay im confused as fuck..  -goodnight each day wait let me rephrase each passing hour seems to be its own struggle.  i\\'m not sure how i am going to deal with another 26 more days but one thing is for certain - i am gonna deal with it.  there is no way i\\'m going to let anything happen in the next 26 days that would make this separation any longer than a month.  the only thing i can seem to do is better myself each and every day... i find myself waking up wondering what i can do to make myself better or make sally proud of me.  im sick of sitting on the couch bitching about my problems and now that my problems can not get any worse with the reality of my passion, motivation, and other half not living with me and hardly being present in my life but by a mere single instant message every couple of days i\\'m making changes so at the end of the month things just seem more comfortable and stable.  love is crazy eh?  i\\'m just having to deal with the back lash of it in all honesty... dare i say i needed this?  well no i don\\'t think i did... i know what i\\'m doing with my life right now is all that i\\'ve wanted to do for several months i just never could find the time or motivation with always just wanting to be with sally doing whatever made her happy... with her absence i\\'m just able to find the time to accomplish all of these important tasks.  this month is working for her i\\'m sure - almost positive the relationship with her parents that she is trying to establish is being established.. and i\\'m sure they are giving her all the support that she needs to ensure that the goals she is setting out to complete in this month are completed.  i guess in essence we\\'re both doing the same things yet our worlds can not be compared.  college. i wish that i was able to live a simple life - where my parents would take care of the majority of my bills and the only thing i was responsible for was basically to perform well in school.  live with sally and go to school and leave the finances to mom and dad.  that would be outstanding... it would actually be perfect... but then on the flipside of that if that were to ever happen... i would loose the one thing that i value most in my life and thats the freedom to do what i want and make all my decisions without having to discuss them with anyone.  i guess the whole, \"no strings attached\" approach has its ups and its downs... i just don\\'t know. *sigh* i\\'m just struggling with the gravity of reality that i\\'m totally on my own in this world.. and the only thing fairy tale about my life is sally.. she is too good to be true ... and right now... this minute... this hour.. this day.. this week... she  is ... to good to be true. god i miss her.  - goodnight.urlLink in a world that is so captivated and intrigued by love, you can not help but to ask yourself; what is the value of love?  well i suppose the answer to that question is different for each person, as is the definition of love.  in the last eight months i have surrounded myself around one person, for everything in my life that made me happy, that one person was always there and part of it.  in fact the only times i have been unhappy in the last eight months was when she wasn\\'t.  now i\\'m having to deal with more than i ever imagined i would have too.  i\\'m having to live in a home that *we* got together and wanted to live in.  now i\\'m living here alone, almost like a constant nightmare that does not go away no matter what you think about before you goto bed.  okay - i can deal with that because 90% of the reason she does not live here anymore is... my fault. then on top of that i\\'m having to deal with this new...\"rule\".  you see sally moved back home and in order to maintain some sort of peace and a good relationship with her parents she has been asked to take an entire month \"off of me\" which means she can not see / talk to me - and if she does then she looses all that her family is doing for her (ex: a car, college paid for, ...).  In a month though we are going to be able to see each other, it will be \"her choice\" whether or not she wants to remain friends or anything more than that...and she will still have all of these wonderful things that her family is getting for her.  so i mean her decision can\\'t shock a whole lot of people, that she chose to do this thirty day deal with her parents ... because in all honesty in thirty days she can have the best of both worlds... right?  well i\\'m still not feeling \"settled\" with all of it.  Something just seems shady... almost like when thirty days is passed does her family actually say \"okay we don\\'t mind this now, you took a month off of him\" or do they say... look we got you all of these things too show you what life could be like for you... and you just go right back to him... i don\\'t know... blah... and its hard because i am waking up every morning being reminded of her absence... and for the last eight months all that i have known is her... and now she is gone so i\\'m even more at loss... really... blah i just don\\'t know what too do... *sigh* oh well i guess we\\'ll see how things play out in a month... well 29 days now ;)  yes i\\'m counting...keep ya updated.  latah. im a pretty cool guy with a whole lot too hide but its hard to get it out cause i got a whole lota pride thats the defense that attacks you when you try to peep my mind im not an apple pie i sin all the time whether i\\'m innocent or guilty of a crime my mind is on constant rewind my heart spews nasty slime through my mind turning it to words that rhyme or just a ball face lie never bad intentions just dont like to see you cry and its easier to lie and hide inside then to hang the laundry out to dry then i defeat my own purpose and make you cry and cant even answer the question of why this wont go away not in any near time the only thing i can do is figure out my mind before i disappear as if you went blind.. im my worst enemy but my war is with time..making a switch in my life to turn the sirens into chimes start focusing on dollars and not pinching the dimes everyone can hate me while i take this time but dont forget one thing remains mine. today was a pretty simple day.  went to pick up  jessica a new friend of mine at her house way out in the ghetto right off of 8 mile.  well she don\\'t live in the ghetto but you have to pass through it to get to where she does live.  anywho picked her up... got lost on the way home but i finally got back on track and found the park i was looking for.. we went to the park for a little while and let capone right wild, that was fun, he enjoyed it - we just walked and talked... that was kind of peaceful.  we ended up watching dave chapelles hbo special, she had never seen it - so that was a lot of fun we did ALOT of laughing.  after that we were about to leave, and mike came up with some weed.  its funny how when you least expect it someone pulls weed out of no where isn\\'t it?  so we smoked - then i drove her home... and got home a little bit ago from that journey.thats all my day really consisted of, and all it will consist of, because now i\\'m going to bed - because i\\'m fucking tired.here is a picture i took today of capone  and jess  - cute.  awwww capone and i have a  new friend we like to hang out with :)here is a picture of her and i watching dave chappelles hbo special...shes good people.-goodnight  i saw the feeling close to my eye coming out from where it use to hide if i said i wasn\\'t enjoying it that\\'d be a lie the question is who are you and why?  i only expected a brief encounter and a good friend never thought that i would have deeper desires for you that i now write down with my pen but here it comes there you are and here i go again.  captivated by your mind, held back by your eyes, embraced by our time, i\\'m not going to fight this or hold back i\\'m going to let it shine.so i went to see \\'fahrenheit 911\\'. it\\'s very impressive, and i certainly recommend that everyone go see it. some of it(oregon state police, etc)seems a bit unnecessary, but the vital and necessary stuff is profoundly vital and necessary. the part of the film that details the involvement between the bush family and the bin laden\\'s and the saudi\\'s is so disturbing that it makes my head ache. some VERY well documented and supported facts: 1-when george bush started his first oil company one of his biggest investors was the bin-laden family(yes, osama bin laden\\'s family). 2-the bush family has received over $1.4 billion dollars from the saudi\\'s and from the bin-laden family. 3-the saudi ambassador to the u.s is an \\'unofficial\\' member of the bush family, and was invited to dinner at the white house on september 13th, 2001. 4-on september 13th over 50 members of the bin-laden family and citizens of saudi arabia were allowed to leave the united states without being questioned by the fbi, even though air traffic was shut down in the united states. 5-on september 11th, 2001 george bush senior and other members of the carlyle group(including members of the bin laden family and citizens of saudi arabia)watched on television as the twin towers were attacked by hijacked planes. 6-almost all references to saudi involvement in 9-11 have been blacked out by the bush administration. go see this movie, and if you doubt what i say then do a little research and you\\'ll quickly realize that we have suffered through an administration(bush\\'s)that is profoundly corrupt in ways that we never could have even imagined. bush, cheney, halliburton, enron, the bin-laden\\'s, the house of saud, and the hundreds of billions of dollars made from oil(iraq has the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world)are why we went to war. there were no wmd\\'s in iraq, there were no nascent nuclear programs in iraq, there was no al qaeda presence in iraq. the sad and tragic truth is that we went to war in iraq for oil profits. that\\'s it, and now we know beyond a shadow of a doubt. and it\\'s utterly disgusting.urlLink click here for showtimes and listings.-goodnight  Nicole, Your comment gave me goosebumps.  Your words were so appreciated. Thanks so much!!Steve.. You are such an amazing person. You inspire me with your perseverance  strength. You have the ability to do what ever you want to do in life, and I\\'ve told you that since the day I met you. You have this amazing quality about you that warms a room up. You have the personality that so many guys wish they had themselves. I\\'ve never met anyone like you - and I must say through the years it has always been a privilge to have you in my life. Your such a doll and I\\'m sorry for all that you\\'ve went through, I\\'m glad your remaining positive and staying on top of life without allowing it to get on top of you. Your amazing.  Forever Friends,  ~Nicole Stockwell :)*taken from the \"thursday\" post*i miss the smell of your hair i miss the feeling of your care i miss the touch of your lips i miss the feel of your hips i miss the planning trips  i miss talking all night i miss holding you tight i miss telling you its alright i miss holding your hand i miss bitching about traffic jams  i miss the good mornings i miss the good nights i miss the good times i miss the good fights i miss telling you to turn off the light  i miss taking showers together i miss the plans of us being forever i miss the dreams that we had i miss wanting those to happen so bad i miss the feeling of wanting you back.  i miss the wanting to give you a hug i miss the comfort of being in love i miss the desire to want to fuck i miss the hurt of seeing you packing i miss the thought of you being attractive  i miss all these things and so much more but i would never allow you back in or even close to the door. there is nothing to miss nothing at all i wish it would have happened faster but then it wouldn\\'t have been such abeautiful disaster  . well after two days of being completely intoxicated its good to have a day that i\\'m able to come to my senses and relax.  i honestly haven\\'t done anything today, and do not have any plans to do anything.  i\\'ve sat on my ass the majority of the night watching the entire season 1 of dave chapelle on dvd. i got moved out of my parents house today - the only thing i have left there now is mah dog which i pick up in the morning, i didn\\'t want to bring him over here and let him get in the way and shit soooo he is still at mom and dads with his brother sam.  ha! he loves it there its great.  anywho... so i got the majority of my stuff out of there and just been sittin down most the evening - @ around 9 my friend sarah came over and watched a few episodes with me - she has to work tomorrow @ 7 so she took off about 20 minutes ago.. so that was kind of cool.so now mike and i are just kind of finishing up the dvd, and then i\\'m probably going to go in the bedroom and crash and burn because the past two nights have just killed me.  i haven\\'t had as much fun as i\\'ve had in the past three weeks in the past year.  its been a fucking riot.  oh yeah... and i finally cut the last bit of communication i had with .... her....  i finally blocked her .  God life is going way to good right now... I FUCKING LOVE IT.  I\\'ve added a link on the right hand side of the page there that links to where i will be posting new pictures and what not.  so enjoy that link :P there are already pictures from tuesday and wends night.  enjoy it.  -cheers to the good life. fuck. i\\'m drunk. so here are the pictures from tonight.  enjoy.  pictures:  urlLink Pictures from Jd\\'s-goodfuckingnight i removed the pictures that were here - because there is a link to the right or in the post above :)  -peace :) i sat in a star bucks parking lot allowing the love of my life to enter my heart only for exactly one year later it to be empty and cold... yet as empty and cold as it is... it still beats... and still holds an empty spot that needs to be filled...to say i will not love again... is kind of like saying i\\'ll never smile again... then one day someone just comes by... and takes you by suprise.  i got so many things accomplished today i was quite impressed with myself.  i ended the day at mikes house, where we spent a few hours over there just bullshitting - then we went over our boy nicks house had a beer or two ... played some darts... i went to arbys because i was FUCKING hungry.  i\\'m home and its 11:20 - i\\'ve got an early day tomorrow - one that i\\'m not looking to forward too, but i am that pay check.  christ i like making my own money and it being all mine what a fucking difference in life style... i\\'m learning how to be selfish all over again... possibly by the end of the week i just might be a selfish person who knows? heh nah i\\'m just kidding... there is nothing i could buy myself that would give me more happiness then it does when i buy for....or use to buy for... ahhh shit it doesnt matter.so far this is my week thats been planned:  ~ wends - JD\\'s ~ fri - Big Secret Party that I know nothing about but i\\'m really excited for it... ? ~ sat - Recover from the party....  sounds fun eh?  okay i\\'m off to bed to catch some shut eye so that i\\'m able to function tomorrow....  -goodnight  second post of the day.... but i just found two cool things i felt the need to share.  as i was sitting bored looking for something to do / or something to read i came across a website that a girl made devoted to her boyfriend.  it sort of reminded me of the old envyme.org - yet this had a rich taste about it.  somewhere on the site i found a simple writing she had wrote about him, and it choked the shit out of me.  so i\\'m sharing it. My love. My one true love. I wake up for this everyday. I breathe for this. I\\'m happy because of him. The smell of his hair. His family. His cats. His sense of humor. His eyes. His sweet attitude. His hands. His \"uh- huh\"s and free back rubs. Everything about him. I love it all. He completes me  theres nowhere else I\\'d rather be then in his arms, with the title \"girlfriend\". I\\'m glad were not arguing.  I\\'m glad were happy.  I\\'m glad we have eachother to talk to.  I\\'M JUST HAPPY.  IT MAKES ME HAPPY TO MAKE HIM HAPPY. now if you notice there was not a lot of creativity put into this, there was not a lot of fancy words, or an effort to rhyme, this was... i\\'m going to sit down... and just write how i feel.  amazing. the second thingi want to share - i\\'ve heard plenty of times but one of my readers sent it to me, and after the past few weeks - for the first time in my life... i can honestly say... it fits...  don\\'t cry because its over, smile because it happened.... this only fits because i have no regrets with sal, in fact i\\'m happy it happened.  i learned a lot about life, relationships, myself, fuck what didn\\'t i learn?  because of my relationship with sally my next relationship is bound to be  fucking amazing  - because of what i learned in this one.  so after much partying this weekend - i think i got it all out of my system.  this weekend was probably the best weekend i\\'ve had since all the drama - only because i didn\\'t really think about it other than recieving a bunch of mail with her name on it - so it just... was an overall smooth weekend. today is sunday, fathers day.  i\\'m not going to go over to my parents and celebrate fathers day today though ... i think i\\'m going to celebrate... \"SONday\" because in reality thats all today really is right?  haha.  anywho so i can\\'t say i\\'m really \\'enjoying\\' the single life - i miss every bit of my old life... but for the circumstances that i\\'m faced with i guess i\\'m making the best of it.  it sucks that sally and i can\\'t even have a simple talk about anything - and neither one of us really know anything about what each other is up to do or doing... so i mean its hard. i talked to a few girls this weekend which i suppose is progress, but i talked about all the drama which i\\'m sure was not too impressive... i\\'m still standing strong on the whole being single thing until june next year.. who knows how that will end up - but fuck at least i got a goal?  i still sit and hope sometimes that when my phone rings its her... and we\\'re going to be able to have a civil conversation and do some catching up.. but those hopes fade away quickly when i see the reality of who is calling.  i wont deny it.  i miss her. ahhh here is some cool shit - i went to JD\\'s piano bar the other day and they called me up on stage as i was up there having a song sung to me... this girl was right at the stage sitting behind the bar that seperates the stage from the chairs... she was standing up... little cute mexican girl... so i picked her up.. over the bar.. and brought her on stage with me... 10 minutes later... she was gone :(  i thought that was kind of funny.  *sigh* so tonight i\\'m staying home... gonna do some cleaning up... tomorrow ... work :(.... and then gym... then.. we\\'re having a small get together at our place for like a ... house warming gig... so.. i\\'m out like a gangstah in the night....  - dont hate  secret note:  hazards 3 times / all the way down the road. having a good weekend so far.. last night was in downtown pontiac for a festival...tonight and tomorrow night are ....classified information  . sorry :(  okay,  will post more when i get back home sunday!!  -peace i guess i should pay my web hosting bill so that i can continue this wonderful, exciting, humanizing journal.  until i do i think i\\'ll still make a quick post.  i never imagined that becoming single would cause my life to become more exciting.  for the last five nights in a row i have been out and have met so many awesome people its.. a bit over whelming.  i wouldn\\'t trade being able to go to different places, and seeing different people, and meeting different people, and forming my own group of friends for anything.  it truely is as if my life is begining to venture out on its own - last night i got my first .... phone call that was like... \"hey come party\"... so of course last night i partied.  *sigh*  june 5th 2005 still going strong...wed night was crazy.  i went to jd\\'s in pontiac which is this little dope piano bar... it was a pretty laid back atmosphere until i had 13 beers in my system and they were about to close - and the guys on the piano started playing loose yourself by eminem... yea things got a little crazy.  *sigh* so after the bar let out.. i ventured to find my car - which was no where to be found... we did find it the next day though after i had to call some girl to give me a ride back home because we had no ride.  i got home and... PASSED RIGHT OUT. it was over.  tonight we\\'re going to some big party @ eastern for a few hours then ending the night in ann arbor for UofM party.  *sigh* all of this partying.... but hey i\\'m meeting lots of new people.. doing lots of new things...  okay.. bye :) so yeah.  we beat the lakers.  crazy eh?  if you want too know more about that you should have watched the game ;).  so tonight was a pretty fun night.. it started out as a little party... became a bigger party... and ended as a huge party.  drunk? well of course.  at some point last night we ended up in royal oak... in the middle of a riot ... where police on horses were yelling at us to stay on the sidewalk.  it was a tad obnoxious but hey i\\'m kind of use to obnoxious things ;)  after the royal oak world war III we grabbed something to eat... met up with a couple other people.. and went to downtown rochester... and.. well... another fucking riot atmosphere... we met some people down there though - ended up going to their house and partying.  over all it was a fucking great night.  still going strong on june 5th 2005 though ;) -good morning tonight was the first night i have actually went out and had a good time without thinking of all of the drama that has been surrounding my life lately.  my buddy mike and i started our night out by going and seeing \"the day after..\" the movie was ... alright.  we followed up the movie by hitting up peppi\\'s sports bar and had a few drinks, he sang a few songs, i rejected a few chicks - and then we continued on with our wonderful night. i didn\\'t realize until the way home.. that i didn\\'t think about all of this bullshit once tonight.  now that is progress.  let me tell you.  so i\\'m sitting here drunk and ... fixing to goto bed because it is an early morning i have to go to work and do the responsible thing... ya know?  (some people have to work for what they want / have) and for those that don\\'t ... yes i\\'m jealous... but at the same time i also have something that you guys lack.. its called pride.  something you will swear you have for the things that are given to you..which you probably do have a bit of pride in the things that are handed too you - 5 years down the line compare your feeling now to the feeling you will have when you get something on your own ;).  Yes that was a stab at some people.  anywho...  So last night Mike and I went to a get together @ his frat buddies house - watched the pistons game which was just unfuckingbelievable... shortly after the pistons game we decided that we were in the mood to celebrate so we went to tonic and got drunk! drank, danced... chatted a bit... it was an overall pretty good fucking night.  okay.. so .. i\\'m out like the drunk guy i am... work in the morning. :(-goodnight :)i\\'ve got what i want... she wont call or contact me anymore... so the games finally over and its time to rebuild, recoup, find happiness alone, and then venture off into the world again as a stronger person.  i\\'m letting everything go... not holding on to the anger or hurt anymore... it takes to much effort.  so i\\'m ending it on this note... i wish her the best of luck in all her future endeavors - and i hope that she is able to get out of life everything she hopes for :)  goodluck sal :)  -peace this morning i woke up to my mom coming in my room @ 8 am telling me \"sally is on the phone for you\".  i was a bit excited, a bit scared, a bit ... excited.  when i got on the phone we talked for a minute and i found out that she had woke up late for her ACT\\'s - and did not know what to do - so without coaxing her too much i persuaded her to come over to my parents which she did - horrible mistake.  after about an hour or so.. we bullshitted a bit / i pissed her off / and she left.  we then decided through phone conversation and online conversation that we just needed to stick to our original plan (read last post).  so there i am just trying to do what i have too to please her and make her happy... and then...  i get a text message on my phone that says \"what u doin?\" - I respond to her and let her know what i\\'m doing and she is just totally pissed off thinking i\\'m doing something else - which i can understand only because my AIM away message said \"out with mike\" and i\\'m telling her i\\'m at my sisters dance recital.. anywho... so we fight fight and fight... then when i get home from the dance recital... i have an IM on my screen.sally (5:34:12 PM): out w/ mike? going on a cruise? i was going to tell you something, but i\\'m not anymore...nothing matters...sorry for IMing you.... my parents are here now, along w/ steph....i\\'ll talk to you when i talk to you....  buh-bye...have fun tonight....i will too, don\\'t worry. later.  Auto-response from ClownSteve (5:34:12 PM): ... out with mike ....so i\\'m not sure what the fuck....to do.  *sigh*.  anyways... so i tried to call her after i got that message to see what it was that caused her to unblock me, then message me, then get pissed off and rub in my face that she was going out too and she was going to have fun... i honestly don\\'t get it. senseless drama.  why couldn\\'t she just call me if she had something ot say?  i don\\'t get it.  anyways so we had our last communication... and now i\\'m off to cresent lake inn... i\\'m going to the bar for the first time in a year too try and ... \"have fun tonight\".  the only down fall to all of this is that i\\'m having to go with someone that dont like bars (my brother)... so its probably not going to be all that fun but fuck.. who knows...  1 year no sex, no girls.  thats my plan.  anyways so thats my post about today... life almost started to feel like it was kicking me in the ribs again... i had to look in the mirror and tell myself i\\'m sick of it.  *gets back up with confidence*-goodnight we finally came to the \"official end\" of our legacy. i\\'m sad but spirited, sulking but joyful.  it was that time we couldn\\'t go on anymore struggling to stay happy, having to hide under the radar from families to stay joyful.  every good thing has its end, and tonight was our end. we ended as best as could be expected, with a hug, and a good-luck.  do i see anything in the future for her and i?  i don\\'t know - i made up my mind a few weeks ago i\\'m trying not to think of her at all in my future because when i do that all of this hurts more... i miss her.. i love her... and i\\'ll always care about her, she will always remain special in my heart...she can always call me when she needs too.  i love her.  so tomorrow i start on to a new journey - one which i\\'m excited yet scared to death of.  i\\'m going to start our simple my 1 year plan goes as follows:  1. job security 2. finance security 3. family 4. friends 5. relationship  i think i\\'m going to take a couple months off of girls in general...that way i can focus on myself.  something i need to do.  so no more booty for steve for months to come... no more anything really.  i\\'m changing my life.. and the change starts now... right this minute... going to bed early :)  -goodnight 80% done with the move... have a few pieces of furniture i need to take care of but other than that i got just about all the important things at my parents house now.  i\\'m here (at the apartment) right now... its rather empty yet still much more relieving then staying at my parents, which was the original plan.  heh not all of us can go from being in unsheltered freedom / back to our parents and have a smooth transition. ;)  anywho.. i will be out of here tomorrow for good.  i\\'ll be at my parents house for a few days until i get another place to stay soooo i will have internet but wont be on it as much... thats all that happened today. so shit was going good and had a real nice feel to it... but then my phone rang... =wont get into that.  -goodnight as i sit in a room glared at by bare walls i have to tell myself i wasnâ\\x80\\x99t expecting this at all.  i flick my ashes and watch them float to the ground i notice i hear nothing there is no sound. a place paid for with hope and destined to fulfill dreams yet no one is here sitting with me.  sometimes i can still hear the joy i still here our pride when we brought home our boy. the visions we shared and the future we planned now all appears to just have been a scam. two months later im all alone sitting on the floor holding my phone wishing i knew the next place i would call home.  i\\'m packing the apartment / plan to move out tomorrow / well at least move my belongings to my parents house (hopefully) and then set out to find a place to live.  being here i\\'m so far away from everything in the world that matters to me, i mean the only reason i was here .... was to convinence sal.  so i\\'m going back up north to be near my job, family, friends...not quite sure where i\\'m going to live right now i suppose an apartment is out of the question with capone being my sidekick - not too many apartment complexes are going to allow a german shepard... so a house is definitly my only option right now *sigh*. sorry for the bad picture... camera phone... gotta love them ;)  okay thats it.  -goodnight i\\'m begining to realize.. i don\\'t need her. *sigh* i never thought i would say that but i\\'m saying it.  each time we talk on the phone there is this feeling, or lack there of that haunts me - its this feeling of unhappiness.  i\\'m not sure why i\\'m devoting so much effort into something that should be so natural.  i\\'m begining to think that sally is more of a convience than anything.  i\\'m trying to force love, love that isn\\'t there anymore.  *sigh*i\\'m begining to see all this..  i know that its possible for me to be happy with out her in my life, that is something that i\\'ve never realized before - but i\\'m realizing it now.  she has been gone a week, and although i have spent that week alone in my apartment, i\\'ve spent this week reflecting on how \\'alone\\' really feels.  although i look forward to her phone calls, and hearing about her escapades - it does not excite me that i will be seeing her friday.  it scares me more than anything.  we are so up and down.  i just don\\'t think there is love anymore - on either side. its about that time where her and i are going to go our seperate ways, i feel it.. and for the first time i\\'m not going to fight it or object to it.  i\\'m ready to walk down the new street to see what life has to offer me.. i mean if its meant to be it will happen right?  we both just need time to find happiness within ourselves again, and in that time we may find other people, we may not, but one thing is for certain - we would be much happier down the road if we were to ever get back together, than we would be if we continue ... \"this\". this sucks.. i hate it... but when i\\'ve come to these conclusions.. something is wrong.  i\\'ve lost hope.  whos knows.. we\\'ll see how things go... its Wednesday morning...see how many more days her and i are able to stand each other... i predict 4.  -goodnightis it possible for us to get along? glad she has hope.  -goodnight *sigh* its not possible for me to describe the confusion that i\\'m going through right now.  i just wish that we could go back to being happy, living with one another.  although that is just a wish / want / hope / its impossible; yet nothings impossible? bullshit.  so here we go another attempt at being \\'together\\' - with the entire world against us something that in the past we have failed miserably at.  the only way we could possibly win this battle was to \"have nothing to loose\" which isn\\'t the case.  sally has everything in the world too loose in this battle.  *sigh*.  the only thing i have to loose is her, yet she is my everything.  i\\'m so fucking stuck..  enough with that shit.  i sat around today waited for her phone call, took capone for many walks - he definitely got his work out on today.  as i type this he is passed out in his cage - tired as fuck.  sally called sometime tonight too let me know she made it safe to Vancouver, that was cool...i guess she is coming home this friday... i\\'m pretty stoked... hopefully nothing happens before then.. i\\'m not planning on friday.. i started taking her and i day by day... that way if something happens between her and i.. the hopes / dreams / plans that are lost with her... aren\\'t there too hurt. i can\\'t wait until i have happy / positive things to post about... i really wish i could write... \"we\\'re living together again\" ... but somethings.... are just...  fucking impossible.  -goodnight soon after..that last post... @ 1:12 am, she called.  in a slumber whisper she told me, she missed me... and that i was.. her boyfriend... and she was my girlfriend... shit just can\\'t stay consistent.  *sigh* i don\\'t know what i\\'m going to do now...i was already feeling the \"friend\" thing...but i\\'m not going to be picky... i\\'ll take her anyway i can... and this way i can still get booty.. so all is well :)  just wanted to update everyone.  okay for real now.  -goodnight its been along time since i\\'ve had to question the status of sally and i.  the last few weeks, almost a month now it almost seems as if it is a constant habit having to question this.  the day before she left for vacation (saturday) we met... and there was \"i love yous\" there was.. hugs and most importantly there was some kisses.  now.. we mock the whole idea behind being \"friends\" because at the end of the day technically that  is  all we are. the night before she left though - she told me that she thought that our friendship \\'was moving too fast\\' and if we continue the way we were going that i would never change.  so i simply agreed with her and continued to tell her that i was happy with her JUST in my life, and was not going to be picky about however that may be.  yet on the phone with her before we let each other go.. i did tell her i loved her once again, not because i was looking for it to come back out of her mouth - but only because i knew she was traveling the next day... and when i feel like telling her, \"hey i love you\" before we get off the phone... i\\'m going to do it - i mean if something were to ever have happened to her on this vacation... i would hold a lot of regret in my heart for not saying it soley because we are \\'friends\\'.  friend or no friend - guess what - i love her. =*|  so now she is on vacation - and i\\'m stuck here not having the slightest clue what her and i are...she said this morning when i repeated to her \"we\\'re just friends..\" she said is that why we were saying i love you, yesterday?? so dude i\\'m fucking confused, yet again... and i\\'m not quite sure what to do with it... its 11:30 pm here... 8:30 pm there and i haven\\'t heard from her all day.  so i\\'m stuck... confused... mad... confused?WILL SOMETHING JUST HAPPEN ALREADY!!!!  OKAY.  -goodnight ronald reagan died today so the pistons take on the lakers this sunday for the nba championship, this should be some what interesting.  right?  = today was kind of boring, basicly did a whole lot of nothing.  after my morning fiascos i came home for a few minutes then shot straight back up north to see sally... heh 50 miles one day and recently i\\'m finding myself doing that trip....twice.. three times a day... wow.. gas =  anyways... we met up at mcdonalds and from there basically we just went too best buy.. left there and.... thats about it =  (would like to give more details but have to respect her right of privacy)  on my way home from there i got really pissed off at the thought of driving another 50 miles back to an empty apartment, i mean i spend the majority of my time here alone - and its just to a point now that i can\\'t stand it ... and the thought really puts anger in me.  (heh as i\\'m typing this capone just went in his cage and went to sleep).  so today i decided i was going to try and get a hold of my buddy that just got out of the army like last sunday... and i hadn\\'t seen him - so i did / he came back down to my apartment with me and we did a lot of catching up.... none the less that was boring too :(  so i drove another 50 miles back up north to drop him off back at home (he decided to tell me he had a car on our way back).  heh its so funny / i realize that my days are so boring .... its my thoughts... my emotions... and basically how i think that seems to be so compelling... yet i find it hard ... to actually write about those in a public enviroment such as this.  *sigh*.  heh okay.  -goodnight just a quick note.  i never intended for this to be a \"daily\" journal - it just turned out that way.  Having this journal is a unique experience, it gives me a place i can come too and vent and allow people to vent with me, agree, disagree, offer advice, opinions but it also gives me the ability to remain private.  although i seldomly keep a post from being published, when i do i usually have reasons why.  the last two days ... and possibly some days too come.. if you notice a lack of posting and updates, this isn\\'t because i\\'m loosing my motivation too post, its me just keeping some of my days private.. i post every single night... before i close my eyes. whether or not i choose to share them... is my discretion.  so i\\'m still alive... the last two days have been hell.  tonight turned out better than i originally expected it too... but then again... i\\'m not sure i go into my days with any expectations anymore...except... my dog to listen? heh... thats my post for the night :)  -goodnight today was hell. in the wake of our Wednesday night just when things started to feel normal again - with the lack of sleep .... and the over whelming frustration of the \\'changes\\' happening between her and i... things went to shit.  we fought / went to bed / woke up and here we are again.... \"ended\".  i begged and pleaded all day and just when i was finished doing so... there you are ready to hang out and squash the entire episode... like this is a fucking game.  you heard me earlier on the phone.. ya know?  you know how upset all of this is making me... you know what you are capable of doing to me... yet one thing was different this evening... ALL day and early night you fucking treated me like total shit, and acted as though what i was going through didn\\'t matter too you and you gave two shits about how i felt only about what you wanted, and about what you felt... you hardly gave me the time of the day other than answering your phone... yet one thing i did notice tonight that will help me out in the future...  the moment i came to reality... that there was nothing i could do, and i am so sick and tired of one day bonnie and clyde against the world / next day bonnie and clyde shooting each other.... that i calmed down and acted like the shit didn\\'t phase me.  the minute you called and heard that i was calmed down and i wasn\\'t \"emotional\" about it anymore... then we were able to fucking squash the stupid bullshit and hang out and actually treat one another like humans... wait on that note... when don\\'t you get treated like a human... i believe that if i talked to you the way you talk to me everytime you get mad... just talked to you ONCE like you talk to me all the time when your mad... you would leave... but i dont.. i stick around... and ya know.. i cant blame a single soul but myself when this hits rock bottom... because i see what your doing... i see what your capable of doing to me... and yet i stand around and take it ... because i have one thing that no matter what... WONT go away....  hope. .....if you guys only knew.... my day *sigh* ;) today we met up around 4... and it turned out to be a fruit bowl of emotions from the very begining.  a major part of me was happy to see you, and feels completed when your around - it just feels \"right\".  then another side of me is scared to get that close to her because i was just so close to being strong and independent of myself and my feelings, and whether i like it or not - it would be impossible for me to fight her breaking into my heart again. in a perfect world her and i could be together and supported regardless of peoples personal feelings of me, they would have enough respect for her as a 20 year old woman to make the right decision, and not have to bribe you too make theirs.  but since this is an extremely opposite world - we are forced to hide our conversations, our talk, our meetings, our days and most importantly our love.  although i was thrilled to run errans with her, from the CVS to office max, to the hospital and back to my car... it was fun, great, enticing, and so comfortable... i even said at one point, \"i wish we were driving back to the tuson apartment right now.. god i miss living with you\".  the feeling i get when your around is just an overwhelming happiness that nothing else can replace - but that happiness comes with a price tag, and thats trust that she will always be there to offer me that happiness and vice versa.  it seems so much easier for her to cope and overcome disaster between her and i, and that is more than likely because of the constant fight she has to put up with her family for me, the... risk of loosing everything she gained when they thought i was gone.  when i\\'m not in the picture she has her sister who provides a gateway into a social life uncomparable to what i\\'ve been able to offer her in the past - then she has all of her family talking bad about me, and my motives.  so to her she is supported 100% in every way when i\\'m not in her life - which i\\'m sure doesn\\'t take away that void in her soul that i fill, but it does help take away the time she has to think about that void. as far as anyone in her family is concerned right now though, i\\'m living in florida which makes things so much easier for her and i too see each other because when i \"lived in michigan\" they were too scared to let her out of their sight at the chance we may see one another...we made a plan today that she is going to go to college in kalamazoo this fall, and until then we will keep whatever it is we have going on, on the downlow... to stay under the radar and not get caught by her parents.  then when she goes to school her and i will have 4 hours distance seperating her parents from her, and that is truely what she needs.  be away from her family yet close enough to see them when she wants.  this will provide such an enormous amount of freedom for her to make decisions for herself, and in every way shape and form... be sally. this is jumping the gun though, you see one of the main reasons i suffer so much from the harsh reality of loosing sally every now and then is because i do so much planning for the future with her - its like i get these visions and begin to form those into expectations... something that i really shouldn\\'t do... but i do.  so i will start today taking it day by day... because i mean we are not obligated too one another right now but at the same time we kind of are... we hug / kiss / say i love you / like a rebel love if you will.  its sad really.  so i\\'m not going to hang on too tight to this hope and dream that this fall sally and i will be able to embrace another relationship away from her family - but i\\'m going to keep it in the back of my head and pray that it happens.  we both still have an entire summer ahead of us that we have to bob and weave our way through so that this can actually happen - as we all know summer affords a lot of oppertunities for chaos... i just hope that we\\'re able to survive this.  *sigh*i think the poem actually speaks for itself - so there is nothing i can really add.  except, comment of course.windows are down as the cool breeze goes by the music is on low so i can hear myself drive  i watch the lines in the road as they go by slow i hear the raine hitting my tires as if it were snow  i can smell the humidity flowing in the air my face is getting wet and i just dont care  every few seconds i watch my windshield get wiped its just at that moment i realize how alone i am tonight  i pull over in a empty lot with really bright lights i get my pen and pad cease the moment and start to write  i begin to observe all which i can see i begin to realize no one else is around but me  i ask myself questions hoping my heart will be honest i ask myself if im able to not be with her this august  its her birthday in 11 days and she is so far away how did all of this happen why wont we share that day  things im pondering inside my mind sitting in the car on august 10th instead of being with her ill go to the bar  not to drink away my pain and sorrow but to celebrate my life and the new tomorrow  1 year ago we were together in texas the farthest thing from our heads was that we would ever be ex\\'s  part of me of course wishes that all of this was a dream but then again if it was i would have never found me  a guy that can sit in a empty lot writing his thoughts a guy that never use to give up on life but always fought  a guy that believed in himself every step of the way a guy that struggles for his future but still knows how to play  a guy that is secure enough to write how he feels a guy that is strong enough to stand up for his ideals  i realize that no matter what is going on with my mind im so happy in life right now why even look behind  life is music and you just have to learn how to dance i think i\\'ve learned enough now, i\\'ll give love another chance  here i am sitting alone in this lot with not a bit of fear if i could be anywhere else in the world i\\'d still be right here.  its 5:30 pm and the invites to places have already began to pour in for tonight. yet i\\'m still so fucking clueless as to what i\\'m going to do - what should i do?  this is the question i\\'m left pondering.  although i\\'m totally not in the mood to sit at home tonight i\\'m also really not in the mood to be in the \"club\" atmosphere.  i do have some options though lets see this is what has presented itself to me this afternoon.  1) Canada with like 12 people 2) Saginaw street 3) I\\'m making this one up right now - The Movies  i suppose the movies would be the best choice because i mean thats more along the lines of what im in the mood to do, now the question is, who the fuck do i go to the movies with?  everyone already seems to have plans.. i don\\'t have a girl (nearby) that i can take, blah.  maybe it\\'ll end up just a \\'steve night\\' - yeah.. that sounds rather refreshing actually, i think i might just go by myself to the movies.  now if you guys wanna show up and watch the movie with me your more then welcome.  i think i\\'m gong to go see the villiage at the star theater by great lakes crossing probably between 9-10.  this is just about the only thing i can think of doing that appeals to me, BUT who knows feelings change, moods change, plans change and then... you get an updated journal entry and see the result of all my trying to plan attempts.  okay i\\'m going to eat a bologna sandwich. peace. \"..help is on the way..\"  is what they chanted as john kerry made promises and gave hope to all americans in his speech.  it was almost as if i was watching a classic wrestling match, the way the crowd interacted with him and said it in unison.it\\'s 4am and i\\'ve just finished watching the speech for the second time.  there were a few statements that he made that i just have to mention, so here i go :)\"we don\\'t go to war because we want too, we go to war because we have too\" \"And let me tell you what we won\\'t do: we won\\'t raise taxes on the middle class. You\\'ve heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes.  I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education.\"  \"The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it\\'s not the story of senators and members of Congress.  Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I\\'m here to say, your family\\'s health care is just as important as any politician\\'s in Washington, D.C.  And when I\\'m President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected Â\\x96 it is a right for all Americans.\" very cool john:  \"I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let\\'s be optimists, not just opponents. Let\\'s build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let\\'s honor this nation\\'s diversity; let\\'s respect one another; and let\\'s never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States.\" these are just a few of the awesome things that he said.  i would say although he seemed some what nervous at first, the speech was effective.  i\\'m looking forward to the next two months more than i have ever looked forward to it before. maybe i should start another blog that i use for my political thoughts?  something i will consider :)  right now this is the place where i come to write, and right now, this minute... this is all i can think of writing about because it has consumed my day, and my thoughts.  for a full transcript of johns speech  urlLink click here .  2008 i\\'ll be part of this: -goodnight. so have you guys been paying any attention to the democratic national convention?  i\\'m sure you\\'ve seen bits and pieces on the news - since this is my journal and not political oriented i\\'m not going to rant and rave about the convention, or my views, nothing like that.  i\\'m going to simply post an over view of trends i\\'m noticing.  one thing interesting about this election, is that \"blogging\" is actually becoming a voice on the web.  at this years DNC there is a whole slew of \"bloggers\" that were invited to come and document the convention, as part of the press.  that is amazing.  here is a picture of them setup at the convention.  this is something new that has never been done before, its as if we (bloggers) are begining to have an impact just as powerful is that of a journalist that types their opinion in the columns of worlds most powerful newspapers.  this is moving. although my blog is more of a personal blog than a political blog, those of you that know me, know that i am very passionate about my beliefs and feelings on politics.  so i\\'ve added some links to the right hand side, that i\\'m reading every day to keep in touch with whats going on at the DNC, that we don\\'t see come through the tube.  also i was able to find a good article full of links and information about \" urlLink blogging from boston \". so is everyone excited for a new president?  prepare. :) they say you can not help how you feel, and i\\'m here to testify that this is the truth.  its impossible.  if it were divorce rates would be on a stead decline by now.  on that note - i am not superman, i\\'m human.  i bleed, i suffer, i breathe, i feel.  you all know who i\\'m talking about in this poem, but try to look past that and focus  what  i\\'m talking about in this writing.  i think the majority of you guys will enjoy it.. i\\'ll turn on comments for it.  let me know your thoughts, and as long as they are constructive i\\'ll continue to let you know mine. the smell of your skin is still tainted in my mind the warmth of your body at night knowing you were still mine  passion in our actions as we kissed away our days the sleepless nights that i would lay awake and pray  your hand upon my leg as we drive into the stars beyond the physical touch your passion went so far  chasing you to the room just to throw you down sitting on top of you staring not making a sound  eyes talking as if they were mouths emotions so pure they pour right out  as we would bath together i could smell your hair taking it for granted now i just think of you there  it is all the small things that i have grown to miss its the simple taken for granted things like a small kiss  feet cold enough to freeze the sun and cause a storm yet everynight i knew it was my job to keep them warm  no insecurities or doubts in my head just knowing you cared enough to look ahead  the dependence you put on me to become a man the dependence i had in you for you to hold my hand  i miss the romance and passion and comfort of love i miss the small things all the way down to a hug  i miss everything in life being more because it was you i miss the goodnights and the i love yous because i know they were true  so these are my secrets that my heart can not hide these are the feelings that im left dealing with inside  is there a cure for all of these deep thoughts will i ever find this again or are they lost. answer to email: the title \"message in a bottle\" is perfect for this poem.  i wrote it and threw it in the ocean.. now we are going to see who reads it. thanks for the note though :) hahaha i never thought this site was ever important enough for \"fan art\" but apparently i might have to go ahead and make that section... haha this is from my friend nina... its ... so real looking.. but anyways.. thought you guys might get a kick out of it :)  thanks nina, it made me smile.*note: the site is not broke, i\\'ve disabled comments for awhile.  i\\'ve needed to get away for a minute, and just have not had the oppertunity with work and everything.  so this weekend i ended up going 4 1/2 hours north west to the other side of michigan to go camping for a day with my family.  i was apprehensive at first only because, i generally don\\'t like hanging out with my family - but it ended up being a blast, the family got along great - everyone was laughing, in fact i had such an amazing time that when it came time to leave there tonight - i hesitated cause i was having so much fun. wierd eh?  so anyways sunday morning i went and picked chad up, and we drove out there together - it was a good road trip there was a lot of scenic shit.  none the less we got up there and found the camp ground (after using the fucking sun to navigate cause mapquest was WRONG!)  so we get up there my parents are not even @ their campsite so ... we go driving around this town to the sand dunes and look for them and low and behold we find them!! what are the chances, anyways sooooooo we ended up going out to the sand dunes in my dads truck... sunday night and having a complete blast out there, driving up these steep fucking hills and back down them... it was ... something you would have to experince my words won\\'t actually tell you anything... but you\\'ll be able to tell from the pictures what i\\'m talking about.  i watched my second sunset in my entire life!! (check out the pics) the first time i seen one was when i was visiting out in san francisco (sun sets right there), and the second one was here... the only thing that was missing... was while i was sitting there watching it... i was IN ANOTHER WORLD wishing someone else was there sitting next to me, buttttttttttt yeah actually... that was the entire trip i wished she was there...i didn\\'t even see this picture until i got home and downloaded the pics, someone must have took it while i was there day dreaming...we got back to the campsite and sat around the fire telling jokes and what not, it was quite wierd - for the first time in ... my entire life i felt like ... we were a family. then i realized lyndsey wasn\\'t there, but it still felt good. i miss her.  anyways it was odd.  i woke up this morning, ate breakfast, and we went RIGHT back out to the sand dunes where we seen a car flip (no one was hurt) and .. we got some more amazing photos of these guys on dirt bikes... flying through the air... all around it was goooood fucking times... my first family vacation i can actually say i enjoyed (even though i did only last a day)... i enjoyed it.  would have enjoyed it more if you were there though..  so thats my post... hope you guys enjoy the pictures... here i\\'ll make it easy here is a linkurlLink click on sand dunessooooo thats my weekend, i wish i had more interesting things to say but i dont.  so... goodnight... and farewell!!  comment on pics  -peace  *ps* - i read  your  comment - thanks for the good luck wishes. today was very uncomplicated.  around 7ish mike and i went to tiki bobs for nicks free party pass thing, we were able to drink for free until nine.. and we took advantage of that.  while i was there i ran into some old high school buddies which was fucking amazing cause i have anot seen them fucks in almost 5 or 6 years... so that was awesome.. we left tiki bobs and headed to rochester to the main street grill, where we all played each other in some pool.  we did have plans that followed main street, and that was to go see a movie, but that all changed when drinks got in us - we decided to roll back over to nicks house and play presidents and assholes... a drinking game, so we picked up a case on the way from cvs andddddd drank our asses off for a little while - i know i got fucked up pretty bad at one point, i had to lay my head on the couch and shut my eyes for a bit - but then i woke up, sobered up, drove home and most importantly made it home safe... its 3:21 am so i did good.  side note:  DONT DRINK AND DRIVE - ONLY FUCKING IDIOTS DO THAT SHIT!!!one day i will practice what i preach until then think of my is king hypocrite, think of me however the fuck you want to think of me.. but i know a few of you guys that read this ... drink and are not even old enough to drink so.. let it me known... if you need a ride... call me see if i\\'m sober.. if i\\'m not... i\\'ll pay for a taxi.. alright?  beat your fucking asses you drive drunk... lyndsey..kelly... dana....jessica..  okay so that is my night... i think i\\'m going to go to sleep now... so goodnight. well yesterday was kellys birthday - she was totally not looking forward to it, i happened to read her journal and just felt bad for her, so i made sure i was the first one to wish her a happy birthday :P .  apparently she got a expensive digital cam for her birthday, can\\'t be mad at that kel :P  anyways hope you had a happy birthday - you were in my thoughts :)  i\\'m not sure what is going on with my dad.  after all the drama i wake up to emails from him inviting me to go camping with him this weekend - i was a bit shocked.  i ended up calling him, and found out chad (my brother) was going to be over there, so i shot over there and hung out for awhile.  ending up laying in the pool for a little while then i had to take off.  it was relaxing just to be in a pool, its been awhile - haha i love to swim so much.  this past winter my old sidekick and i ran up in hotels and used them for their pool, and then we would bounce and go home.  it was gangster.  anyways so yeah it was nice to fucking lay out in the pool. left there came home and just got really lazy and bored.  it was.. disgusting really.  at some point i think around 10:30 i decided to go out and went over to tonic for a little while, had a few drinks, danced, but the most interesting part of the whole entire night i would have to say was....  i was up at the bar just kind of observing the dance floor, when i noticed this black man walk by me - wearing this necklace that was blinding, straight bling.  as i looked up at his face, it was almost as if recognizing a child hood friend - obie trice was a hand length away from me... as i looked at him he looked at me.. i kind of grinned like.. i know who you are none of these fuckers do.. i was like whats up man.. anyways we ended up talking for about 10 minutes - i told him his CD was one of the better CD\\'s to come off the shady imprint since the eminem show, he smiled and said \"listen to this...\" and pulled a cd out of his pocket - it is just a burned CD straight out of the lab, bad ass song - produced my eminem.  he ended the conversation by saying, \"alright man i have to get up there..\" (V.I.P) - it was dope.. but the dopest part after he walked away from me, he came back like 5 seconds later and was like whats your name again... who knows small world whatever.. he dont remember it now..  sooo i\\'m home now... been home for awhile... waiting for lynn to get online because i really wanna talk to her... she is on the phone right now :(  so thats just about where my night stands right now... i\\'m watching the dave chappelle show - erika badu or however you spell her name is doing a performance... alright well.. i\\'m out like a thief in the night :)  -night. ps. let me know what you guys think of the new look. :) i breathe in and blow it back out watch the smoke come floating out of my mouth.  i lean my head back and close my eyes and rest my body on the couch.  i begin to have thoughts of how i survived how im still here how im alive.  i dont know when it happened or how but its then i really begin to realize.  i dont feel the pain i dont think of you in vain to me your just a memory just a name.  i dont feel abandoned or left alone to rot i dont wish you were here im glad that your not.  i miss what we had but not all of the bad and i wouldnt take you back cause it would all come back.  i will search out another treasure that does not ever bring pain but only pleasure. i pick up my head from leaning back on the couch i open my eyes and i know what all this is about.  i put out my cigerette with ease of mind, finally feel relaxed for the first fucking time.  i just realized where i am, im alone and surviving its proof that i can.  i felt the need to write what i realized tonight i know its a little sappy but thats alright  i couldn\\'t help but share with everyone...  im finally fucking happy .  why am i up?  its 3:30 in the fucking morning there is no need for me to be up.  nothing entertaining is going on, there is no one to talk to online, and most importantly, i have a lot of things that i need to accomplish tomorrow.  why am i still up?  who the fuck knows.  the more i think about it, the more i fear i\\'ll never get tired, so here i am - in an attempt to do something which ordinarily relaxes me :)  the stuff party last night was pretty dope.  by now the majority of you guys have seen the pictures, so you know it was looking like a good time.  to answer all of your questions at once, the band that was playing was darren mcarty\\'s band (he is a defenseman for the detroit redwings) - they were alright.  the best part of the entire night was the fact that i got fucked up - i hardly drank a drop, but when it came to smoking - i smoked.  it was ... wonderful :)  i danced the majority of the night after the band got done playing - as a matter of fact i could not find it in me to stop dancing, i just danced... and danced... and danced.  came home, posted real quick, and crashed.  today was fun. mike and i went to the rec center and practiced dodge ball, well that was the plan but seeings a lot of people did not show up we substituted our game for a quick run of the gym hitting the weights, and then for a quick game of one on one basketball.  so regardless we got our workout on.  we ended our wonderful day at arbys where we picked up dinner.  the minute i got home i showered because i was EXTREMELY hot.  that was fucking amazing - orgasmic really.  so now i\\'m up and i can\\'t sleep.  but now i\\'ve posted, so maybe i\\'m relaxed enough to try again.  alright here i go ... 1... 2... 3...  latah.  ps.  i couldn\\'t be happier with life right now :)the party was fucking dope is hell!! i danced my ass off for the majority of the night - and i didn\\'t drink hardly anything (i did get high though)... not that much to post though... the party was dope... i had a blast... and there are new pictures :)Enjoy!!-goodnight BASICS  Your gender: guy  Straight/Gay/Bi: straight..

Are you going out?: stuff magazine vip party  What are you wearing right now?: khaki\\'s white button up shirt lugz.. i\\'m looking sharp  What are you worried about right now?: money  What book are you reading?: Nicholas Sparks - The Notebook  Use 5 words to describe how you\\'re feeling?: excited, frustrated, cunning, impressive, intelligent  Are you bored?: nahh  Are you tired?: nope  Are you talking to anyone online?: no  Are you talking to anyone on the phone?:no  Are you lonely or content?: i\\'m content with being lonely  Are you listening to music?: no but i cant stop singing paint me a birmingham...today was busy. i\\'m not use to busy days :) it was nice. mike and i took the girls back to baycity.. we stopped for lunch on the way home at A  W i didn\\'t realize how good their fucking food was - i was diggin that place. anyways i started the drive... and with the lack of sleep and the honestly not really paying attention... about 25 minutes into the trip... mike says, \"dude we\\'re going north..\" so yeah. i wasted alot of time driving in the completely opposite direction of home, so i pulled over and was like \"your driving\". so i got the chill for a few hours on the ride home - it was relaxing although i didn\\'t get to sleep as i had planned i was to caught up in the music... that happens sometimes. after we got back home we chilled for a few minutes, and went directly to my dads house to go pick up all of my shit that he was storing for me - that was fun. he is such a fucking idiot - he emails me and plays this hardass, that doesn\\'t give a fuck about his kids, implies he pretty much hates us, and then when i show up expecting the worst he is going to act like he is my best friend. what the fuck. i said maybe two words to him, for the first 20 minutes while we packed up the back of mikes truck - and then all of the sudden i think he kind of detected that there was some tension coming his way from me - and he out of know where offered me to use his van with the trailer so i only had to make one trip... awww how nice of you pops, its the least you could fucking do. i\\'m not going to complain, it made things a hell of a lot easier on time. so i got to mikes and just threw all of my shit in the garage where i\\'m going to store it for now... i think i\\'ll break into it tomorrow or something.. i don\\'t know. its going to be nice to have my desktop back though. anyways. so i left back towards my parents house to return the van and i heard a song... and the fucking song just fucked with me, i\\'ve heard it so many fucking times in the past but i\\'ve never listened to it - this time i listened to it ... and it fits... i dedicate to my parents (staind - for you). got back with the van and my dad had company over, so as i went to go give him the keys and let him know i was leaving he became dad of the year and offered me dinner. i was fucking shocked. (no matter how much i hate you i can\\'t turn down free food.) so i ate. then he said, \"why don\\'t you party with us tonight...\" i almost started having seizures. i think it is so funny that he thinks he can pop in my life and out of my life playing the dad role when its convient for him. when no one is around and he is just miserable, he don\\'t like me, or us for that matter. but god damnit if his friends are around he is a \"cool dad\". fuck you. i hate you.your a piece of shit of an excuse for a dad and i regret every single day of giving you another chance to be there and be a dad  ... i should have went with my fucking mom to florida.i fucking hate him  . but he don\\'t think anything is wrong with him, he thinks everybody else is wrong. lets look at the facts.  i moved out when i was 16  chad moved out when he was 17  lyndsey just moved out (she just turned 17)  kristyn left the day she turned 18wow, i notice a fucking pattern. blah. i fucking hate him.  anyways so that was my night... well there was more buti can\\'t talk about it cause it just don\\'t involve me and it wouldn\\'t be very nice of me to divulge other peoples business... ya know? so yeah. hope you enjoyed my post... its the first one in awhile that i\\'m venting in. i\\'m pissed, i can vent right? i can\\'t be cool all the time.. shit gets exhausting ha.... alright enjoy ya\\'lls weekend :)so yesterday was interesting to say the least. mike and i met up with a girl and her friend (fahlon  krystal) up in baycity - which by the way was a long fucking drive. so we went and picked the girls up, on the way home we stopped at burger king - which was kinda fun because they were wearing some skirts that were... lets just say \\'short\\', and well it was windy outside :). we got back to the house and just started to get fucked up. i\\'m not sure why, i\\'m not sure how, i\\'m not sure even... when... but i know right after we arrived here we started drinking.. and then we ended up out in the garage smoking... eventually we ended up @ tonic night club dancing and drinking. it was a pretty dope night - up until bed time, but thats another story in itself. i\\'m sitting on the floor right now because i had to be the gentlemen and let them sleep in my bed, and well i\\'ve been awake laying on the floor since 3 am with no sleep- finally i decided i was going to call it quits and just stay up today because it would be pointless for me to even sleep, i still have to drive them home. i\\'m not looking forward to today at all. as soon as i drop them off back in baycity i have to go to my dads house and pick up all my crap from the old place and bring it over here - something i\\'m not looking forward too, nor do i want to do. if the majority of the shit over there wasn\\'t so fuckign expensive i wouldn\\'t think twice about leaving it over there. here is what i had in my inbox this moring :)  -----Original Message----- F  rom: Stephen Parent [mailto:tool*****@hotmail.com] Sent: Friday, July 16, 2004 3:55 AM To: Steve Parent Jr Subject: NOW  Stevie, Come get your shit today or it will be moved to the purple heart or red cross I am not kidding.god do i love my fucking father. :) this should be fun - i\\'m sure i\\'ll have a lot of wonderful things to post about tonight!! blah fuck you pops!! so i think i\\'m going to let them sleep for another hour, then wake their asses up so i can get my day started - they are some cool ass chicks to kick it with... we will probably do it again in the future.... so yeah thats my post. oh yeah - new pictures :) - good morningok, can i just talk about gw bush the \\'good ole boy\\'?  i mean, come on...  gw bush went to andover. and yale. he\\'s from greenwich, connecticut.  he vacations in maine.  and don\\'t get me wrong, andover, yale, greenwich, and maine are all lovely places.  but they\\'re not exactly breeding grounds for \\'good ole boys\\' who drive rusty pickup trucks and herd cattle(gw bush most likely grew up stealing golf carts and occasionally riding polo ponies, both of which are fine adolescent, preppy pursuits, but are not the sort of pursuits that people associate with good ole boys from deep in the heart of texas).  it just galls me when gw goes out and plays cowboy and some of the voters actually believe that he\\'s a man of the people.  gw bush exists to serve his billionaire masters, and that\\'s it.  so the next time you see gw pretending to be a good ole boy or a man of the people just remember that he grew up summering in good ole greenwich connecticut getting drunk on golf courses and bragging about his rich daddy.  if gw bush is a cowboy from texas then i\\'m a weight-lifter from siberia.just seen him on the news and got annoyed.-goodnight for the first time in forever i forgot my phone in my car.  this is normal, as i\\'m sure that many of you reading this have done this as well.  it is abnormal for me though - ever since the bullshit... my phone is plugged in and charges in the same room as i am while i\\'m sleeping... well last night i forgot it in my car.  which i suppose shows progress... i mean before i\\'d get dressed up to go back outside and grab it before i goto bed... but last night, not a thought in my head about it. so if that is any type of measure of my progress i suppose its a good steady incline of my overall progress, right?there were a few \\'firsts\\' for everything today.  when i woke up the first thing i did was LOOK for my phone, which was as i said - out in my car.  so i grabbed a cigerette and walked outside - go to my phone.. and someone called me @ 5 am... private name.  i have a very  strong  feeling who it was...and that to me is irony.  the first time i leave my phone in the car, she decides to call.. if that isn\\'t a sign.  anyways.. i hope everything is fine with you, and everything is okay.  i remember what the \\'5 a.m.\\' phone calls are about.. and i hope your night was alright, drama free.  sorry i didn\\'t pick up.  none the less...there is nothing else to post.  -goodnighturlLinkurlLink \"honesty\" it is something that i\\'m learning.  for in the past i would have been \\'afraid\\' of sarah\\'s reaction to \"the truth\" - but now i speak of nothing but, and the reaction is... at first is understanding and support - but the long term reaction is her disappearing out of my life.  do i regret telling her the truth? not at all.  you see truth is always the best policy and the reward is often so much more than you expect.  yes it sucks that she does not want to see me or hang out with me because it sucks for her, but at least she knows that i was real with her - and we aren\\'t ending for any \"odd\" reason for which she couldn\\'t understand or comprehend.. we are ending because everything was put out in the open with my feelings - and it is simple to understand.  i miss her though *shrugs* but its best.  i think that was just considered, \\'rambling\\' was it not? anyways.  so today was pretty lame. (as i\\'m typing this capone is laying on the bed with me ... making funny noises looking at me wanting to go to sleep - fuck i love him).  i stayed home most of the day... OH WAIT.  at somepoint this afternoon... i went outside for a cigarette and the neighbors across the street were outside in a fist fight, i wish i had my camera that shit was funny.  capone was barking at them, trying to play cop dog and shit... haha it was funny.  so back to my day.  i just chilled today - around 9ish i went back to the techno festival - danced around quite a bit.. it was fun.  got home from that, had a glass of ice tea then went to kelly\\'s apartment and watched \"ghost ship\" that is an alright flick.  not anything i would ever want to watch again - but glad i watched it.  one of those things. i\\'m feeling better about everything.  i honestly think having sarah, well not the concept of having sarah - but the \\'cloud\\' that over shadowed sarah and i\\'s friendship was putting more stress on me then doing me good.  your thinking, \"what cloud?\" - well the cloud of being friends but being that tad bit more?  we have all been there.  so i think with that out of the way, it is helping me cope with things better.  i wasn\\'t ready for anything other than a friendship - and i know that.  so now i can do this without a constant reminder of negetive shit.i\\'m going to pick myself up, continue on with my journey, and keep writing my story.-goodnight  after i posted tonight i had to come back and post this picture... i seen it and laughed - so if it makes anyone else laugh.. its worth posting :) enjoy! - capone shit  - cleaned up capones shit - went to techno fest - added new pictures to my pictures - started writing a book (more details later) - danced a lot tonight - kelly and jessica stopped over for a bit - talking to lynn right now - added new feature to site. i can now call a phone number from my phone and record a message and it will post here to the site for you guys to listen too, when i\\'m not able to find internet access and i want to post.  so sometimes you\\'ll get my voice opposed to this.  Example :urlLink last night i went to lush barroom again.  that was kind of cool.  afterwards i went to kellys apartment and attempted to watch fight club. left there came home let capone outside, where he got bit by ants so i had to give him a bath at 6 am. fun? no.  then mike called and wanted a ride home from where he was at - so i didn\\'t end up going to bed until like 7 am this morning.  sucked. today i\\'m going to see anchor man - and then heading out to downtown pontiac for the \\'techofest\\' which should be a blast, i\\'m excited for it anyways.  we\\'ll see how that goes.  bye.does he kiss you and give you butterflys? do you see your future when you look in his eyes? when you touch his hand does it feel like hes your man? when you lay down does he play with your hair? when ever hes gone are wishing he was there? when you fuck each other do you think of me? do you just wish sometimes it was still sally and steve? when he holds you at night does he gently rub your sides? does he rub his fingers through your hair to let you know that he cares? when you drive in a car do you wish your destination was far? would he ever move to 2 different states to stay with you? would he ever sacarafice his entire life because it felt right and true? do you miss the comfort of waking up and not caring how you look? does he know what gets you going like he has read your book? when you lay with him at night do you ever see my face? when you goto your dreams am i still there in that place? do you wonder if i am thinking of you as much as you are of me? do you ever hear a song and just want to say i miss steve? do you ever think of our good times and just want to scream? do you ever look at where we were a year ago, and wish we could go back? do you ever look at the moon and think about how i wanted to give it to you? do you ever wonder if i\\'m still in love? do you ever wonder if i miss your kisses and hugs? do you ever wonder if im fucking? do you even care who i\\'m hugging?  does he kiss you and give you butterflies? or is it just a coverup of how you really feel inside?  it is for me.  its 10:17 pm and i\\'m sitting here with capone.  lots of invites out tonight but i really felt the need to just relax tonight - my body feels so exhausted.  which is odd.  i eat better now than i have in the past year.  yesterday for example sarah grilled me some ribs, the day before that she grilled me some chicken cabobs, the day before that she grilled me some steak.  as i write this i\\'m wiping away juice from a fruit cocktail i just made after an extreme grocery purchase at meijers.  i often think to myself, sally would be happy to see how i\\'m living now opposed to how i was while we were together - but then i think to myself i wouldn\\'t be living this way if she was here - i\\'d be too focused on other things.so i\\'m not doing anything tonight - at all.  no sarah, no club, no bar, no drinking, no nothing.  me and my homie capone... chillin.. about to turn on the tv and see whats on.. probably fall into a deeeeep sleep.  blah. im not in a good mood.  -blah fucking blah.. goodnight.  mike, sarah, and i went to this club tonight.  it was the awesome!!  we ended up first of all walking in, not having to stand in a line - then i met the two girls that run the production company who hosted the party... and they gave us free drinks all night - i think between the three of us we bought... 1 drink.  we all got drunk very very very very cheap.  great music, great people, great atmosphere.. it was just as dope as it could be.  actually tonight was amazing.  i wish i would have taken my camera into the club so you could see pictures of mike breaking it down - hahaha i even got into the action.. we were having such a blast.  i danced with dana, it made sarah act a little wierd - that lasted for about 20 seconds i think when she realized i didn\\'t really care what she thought - because i\\'m not going to be all up on her.. or any female for that matter ever again.  i\\'m gonna have fun and do what i want... because thats how its suppose to be.  so she didn\\'t say anything to me and chilled out - and we ended up having a really goodnight.  we left there, dropped off sarah... and mike and i hit up the taco bell in waterford.  lol drunk and eating..it was such a good idea.  sarah? yes here is a picture sarah  so this is sarah.. she is dope.. very sweet.. very kind... and she is  very  independent. :)  anyways.. thats my day / night... and.. now i\\'m out like a gangster in a cop movie.. peaaaaaaaaaaaace!!!  oh wait. thought i would mention.... stuff magazine party.. detroit... july 17th... catch me in the august issue... i will be sittin V.I.P with mikey and the family... hahaha I\\'M PSYCHED!!!  -peace today was kind of fun.  mike and i went to the \\'village square\\' which is a mall based outside.  very neat.  it is a shame that it was so hot that my shirt was becoming soaked and we ran to the car to get in the A/C.  *sigh*.  capone got some training today.  he now can catch a ball/toy in his mouth when you throw it up in the air.  neat eh?  i guess the \\'training\\' he got today was to just sit the fuck down and wait for me to throw the ball.  he learned it very quickly, i was really impressed.  i still can not believe how fucking smart this dog is.  after that mike decided he was going to do some home work so i took off to sarah\\'s house to pick her up, brought her back here - where mike was waiting for us.  we then proceeded to go to nick\\'s house and drink, tell jokes, and make fun of each other all night :)  it was... fun.  came back dropped mike off, then took sarah home, then came back here... (where i sit this moment).  i\\'m beginning to feel like the world is slowing down for me, opposed to a month or two ago i felt as if it was moving to fast for me to even plant my feet to attempt to catch up.  i feel like i\\'m slowing down time.. or i\\'m speeding up with it, and i\\'m beginning to catch up with everything about me.  is there still some things i want to change? of course there is - the only difference now is, i feel like i can find the time to change them, do them, and make them more meaningful rather than do things... and procrastinate until the last minute. (blah i\\'m rambling).  what i\\'m really trying to say is... i\\'m becoming more focused ... i\\'m becoming more ... myself again.. with each passing day it gets easier and easier.  today on the way home from sarah\\'s house i had all the windows down in my car and the music turned off, i was just doing some deep thinking.  wisdom is something that comes with age, and time, mistakes, failures.  now if i was as wise as i am now.. months ago - i would have never had to deal with the situation that i\\'ve had to deal with, but i wasn\\'t as wise then - in fact i was nieve.  through this i\\'ve become more wise, and less nieve.  i will never gamble \"myself\" for the hopes and dreams of anothers happiness.  never again.  so i\\'m becoming more wise - and as i was driving tonight... thats one positive thing i can say about all of this.  i\\'ve become more wise.. and since you can\\'t learn wisdom, and you can\\'t teach wisdom, its just ... experince... it feels good to know that i\\'m growing up... because.. wisdom is key to happiness.. because if your not wise.. happiness is easy to loose. -goodnight.  ps. new picture of capone... more on my pictures page. ...what..we were high @ 1:30 am...  ...more pics available in the picture section (link on right hand side). i stare at your eyes and am too scared to see whats inside i lie awake staring at the ceiling wondering if this is keeping me from healing as much as i want this to grow i want it to be strong so lets keep it slow we are still friends but we both know its beginning to be as if this is all pretend the bridge of companion has not been crossed - but our friendship still remains at risk for loss a wonderful friendship filled with fun, to a relationship that i\\'m scared of and i might run  im beginning to feel as if its best we stay friends that way our beginning is guaranteed to have no end im not completely over her and this i cant pretend so please try not to be selfish and be there as a friend i just need some time to find what is mine again.  your to perfect in your own beautiful ways i totally enjoy your company every one of our days yet im beginning to loose my own fragile time i still need space for myself to reflect and unwind your friendship is rare and special to me i want more from you but right now this is all i need  friendship. well lets see. last night i spent the night with sarah again and we had long exhausting sex until the sun came up, it was outstanding.  actually i\\'m kidding but thats what people seem to assume when you mention staying the night with someone, well another sex i suppose.  with all the partying going on neither one of us were really in the mood to do much of anything, so we decided that we would just chill out - so we went to her house and grilled out... chicken cabobs... haha they were dope.  ran up to the party store and bought a 12 pack.. and we just sat around and drank some beer and talked all night - it was very relaxing.. i was.. happy.  update:today i TOTALLY RELAXED. it was wonderful.  at some point tonight i think around 12:30ish or so mike and i drove back out to waterford to meet kelly @ cvs and we smoked a bowl with her.... got some white castle after she finally found the one that she \"knew\".  yes that was wonderful.  that is all i did today it was a lot of fun actually.. i couldn\\'t have enjoyed today more. tomorrows to do list: - bank - car insurance - condo - sprint - work at some point - possibly if time take capone out to park  thats it...- peace  goodnight well last night sarah, mike and i all went to kelly longs house and watched a movie... (Valentine?) with heather and her.. did some drinking.  afterwards we took off and i ended up staying the night at sarahs because she was home alone (her moms out of town) and she wanted me to stay.. (wimp).  so i stayed.  today we woke up came and picked mike up and drove to the beach where i got a REALLY nice tan... pictures coming soon :Pthen now i\\'m waiting for mike to get out of the shower.. we\\'re going to get our hair cuts... picking sarah up... hitting up downtown detroit... and we\\'ll see how the night plays out. hopefully i can get some good pictures of the weekend!! alright peace!! today was alright.  didn\\'t really do much.  went to a soft ball game tonight with sarah and mike, we drank a few beers - then went to the bar with the team to celebrate their first victory.  we ate pizza, drank beer.  dropped sarah off, came home too let capone out and grab some.. goodz.. :)  left from here and went to jessicas.. picked her up... we smoked... came back to the house chilled watched \"Ice Age\" some animated flick.. got 3/4ers of the way through the movie and..... she had to go home... SO... went ALLLLLL the way back to 8 mile and dequinder and dropped her off... and now i\\'m just getting back...  thats fucking it..  had fun today but on the big scale of life.  today was lame.. looking forward to the weekend.  -peace COURT BIATCHHHHHHHHH! today was just... disgustinglyisn\\'t that just fucking adorable?  god i love this fucking dog.  -goodnight this post will not be long tonight i don\\'t think, but then again who the fuck knows.  my mood the last few days has been quite cynical.  which does not make sense since right this moment, i have more going for me in my life than i have in months.  i don\\'t get it.  anyways i already posted about this but i made it private.  sorry i do keep somethings private, when i know its in my best interest.  sue me.  it is so hard for me to sit here and write, without venting.  i\\'ve written 3 lines and just erased them. today was interesting.  i got the job i\\'ve wanted forever.  yes, caught you off guard did it not?  i have neglected to post about it in any of my posts, because of \\'doubt\\' with getting the job.  today was my second interview, this time with the regional manager, and i got it.  he will be calling me tomorrow to tell me when i start.  i\\'m fucking geeked.  i have to tell mah people now that i\\'m going to be leaving them, they will get over it.  so i got a job - that i wanted - that i will enjoy - that ... i like.  i will post more later on that subject. after the interview which was out in the middle of no where (southfield) it really isn\\'t the middle of no where - but i wanna say it is, k? :)  afterwards on my way home i stopped by one of my friends worked and kicked it with them for a few minutes... then i went out to lunch... came home.  after i got home i chilled for a bit of time here, and then went over to twelve oaks mall with mike and we did some shopping, that was fun.  we came back home - i was bored with nothing to do so i got in my car and drove around for 2 1/2 hours ... just drove.  because thats what i do when i feel like i need to get my thoughts together or... need to do some thinking or figuring out.  it did not help, the more i thought, the more confused i got.  maybe one day i\\'ll be able to be candid about whats going on with me, but at this point, i wouldn\\'t even wanna talk about it.  because it is so personal and deep.  oh yeah the pictures from the other night are posted too - in the \"random\" folder.  i think by now you guys know how to get to my pictures - so i\\'m not going to tell you how.i take a deep breath in slowly it comes out i begin to listen to my mind but it just shouts  i wish i could tear my heart apart so it would die i might not love again but i\\'d feel better inside  im torn in two my face is blue all because of you im getting weak why this week dont fall stay on your feet  i wish i could pen to the world how i truely truely felt but that would be like giving an abusive dad a belt  im trapped in my own mind its like a land mine every where i step i have to take my time  im want to rip open my head and show you whats inside im not sure what it is but i know it isn\\'t kind  such a different person i am this very night if i knew why i think i\\'d be alright  im just frustrated with where im at in life im just frustrated i have to start all over finding my light.that just came out as i was typing the post.  sorry for having such a negetive post, but if you review my last like uh 30 posts i don\\'t think you\\'ll find a negetive one so i think i\\'m entitled to being \\'down\\' once in awhile... this was my night.  dont read too much into it, you might hurt yourself.  comments are off on this one.-goodnight today was interesting to say the least.  i felt like i needed \"alone time\" today.  i took capone to the local college campus here, and we bonded for about two and a half hours, he played fetch, then we relaxed, then went for a long walk.  it was rather refreshing, and allowed me to get some thoughts under control.  it was peaceful.  on the way home i stopped by an old friends house too see if they were even still alive, which they were.  so i spent about 3 hours at their house, then i came back too drop capone off.  went back to their house picked them up and we drove around all night, and just talked about did a lot of catching up.  i feel like i got a lot off of my chest, i mean i have people too talk to that i wouldn\\'t trade for the world, but when you have someone to talk too who knows and has witnessed and has seen with their own eyes some of the things you want to talk about - it makes things a lot more relieving for the mere fact they can give you their opinion based on knowing the past, and the people involved in it.  so it was interesting, insightful, and entertaining.  tomorrow is going to be a very busy day - i\\'m totally not looking forward to it, but hey i guess busy days are a whole hell of a lot better than lazy boring days.  it kind of takes you through life, but life with meaning or something.  so thats whats poppin on my end of things... i haven\\'t checked to see if kel posted the pics of last night or not.. i guess i will check right now. ClownSteve: you get the pics downloaded? Kelly: theyre on my computer but not one livejournal or nothing im about to pass outso i guess i\\'ll have those up tomorrow, or whenever she is able to get them over to me.  they are funny.  okay i\\'m in for the night.-latah before i forget let me write these funny quotes down from tonight\"can you imagine if peter parker was high?\" \"steve this thing is so long and big\"  (burrito at taco bell)\"is this the CD?  no. then how are you starting it over? im not, its the radio.\"  (Eminem - Stan)  so tonight i was pretty fucking bored.  so i decided to go out with kelly and talk bullshit and have some fun, it ended up being kelly, jessica, nick and i but we still ended up having a goodtime - after we found some \"goods\" we went and smoked, in kelly\\'s apartment complex, afterwards we decided that it\\'d be fun to go pull some secret bullshit off (can\\'t write here) - we ended up going but not being able to pull the secret bullshit off.  it sucked - actually in retrospect i think we may have had a chance, had we not been high of course.  the odds against us just seemed to increase being high.  who knows.  tonight was pretty intoxicating though.  i don\\'t think i\\'ve laughed as much and as hard as i did tonight, in a long time.  in a real long time.  but tonight just seemed so genuine and peaceful.  there was just a lot of good karma tonight, i really enjoyed it - we all had a complete blast and we all were involved in the chaos in the car.  it was fun.  i definitly could never smoke weed habitually but once or twice a month, i dont mind it.  especially on a night like tonight where you are with the right people and there is that awesome karma going on, positive atmosphere, its nice and relaxing.  anyways so i\\'m home now its 3:42 am.  saturday night i went over to my parents house for a get together, i brought capone with me.  it was a good time lots of people over, including my favorite person in the world, lyndsey.  yes saturday lyndsey saw my dad for the first time since may when she moved out, not just saw him but, she talked ot him.  it was sad.  she got there with her boyfriend and they walked out into the backyard back by the pool, where everyone was swimming.  she went and hugged my mom, and then over to my dad and he wouldn\\'t let go of her, and they told each other they loved one another - and after all of that he actaully spoke to ryan like ryan was a person.  called him boss at one point in the night too, which was a bit odd.  none the less it was nice to see them overcome that huge obstacle, i know exactly how it feels for our dad to finally accept someone who he hated in the past.  it takes a lot of stress away.  so we partied there that night for a little while.haha i put saturday first.  friday night i had to go to bed early because i had my dodge ball game saturday morning.  i didn\\'t end up going to bed of course until 5 am because lynn and i talked all night, it was fun though.  so with my two hours of sleep, at 7:30 am i was at royal oak kimball high school for this dodgeball game.  the game was alright, for us not ever playing dodgeball in a professional enviroment, we did damn good.  2nd place out of 27.  it was kind of suprising actually because when mike created the team over their website, he did it in the competitive league.  well, we got there and we found out realy quick we were suppose to be in the recreation league.  oh well - couldn\\'t change it - so we totally were the underdogs and came out on top.  it was fun.  then all the bullshit i already posted above i did saturday night and today.  i realize i typed this backwards but mi erus uoy nac erugif ti tuo. so that was my weekend.  and thats the end of my post.  -cheers.  (should have pictures of tonight tomorrow)  Since I really have nothing else to post at this moment, I figured I would go ahead and acknowledge some of my favorite comments I\\'ve gotten.  I guess Dana leads the group...I think ive read this like 5 times now.. and every time i read it i mean to leave a comment but I am either amazed or speechless at the end! IYou seem to have a lot of lady fans! Kepp it up lol one of my favorites:  Your smarter than you act... i liked this one a lot too:  ok i already told you this in IM but imma tell you again...this i think has to be my fav of yours. your stregnth amazes me...but you amaze me just about every day steve. you deserve to have a smile on your face at all times...and you deserve ALL the happiness in the world.lynnthis was funny:  you  mike = PIMPS  the end.lynn this was touching:  Steve.. You are such an amazing person. You inspire me with your perseverance  strength. You have the ability to do what ever you want to do in life, and I\\'ve told you that since the day I met you. You have this amazing quality about you that warms a room up. You have the personality that so many guys wish they had themselves. I\\'ve never met anyone like you - and I must say through the years it has always been a privilge to have you in my life. Your such a doll and I\\'m sorry for all that you\\'ve went through, I\\'m glad your remaining positive and staying on top of life without allowing it to get on top of you. Your amazing.  Forever Friends,  ~Nicole Stockwell :) this one makes me smile when i read it:  w/e bitch! i knew where it was! lol u got ur sick ass white castle but those chicken things are kinda good- but maybe just cuz we smoked b4 that?touching as well:  Steve,  You know you\\'re like a big brother to me. It\\'s scary because you\\'ve been more of a big brother to me than my own brother has. I never really tell you but you mean a lot to me. As you\\'ve seen before, I\\'m always going to be here for you. Even though you may do something that prevents us from talking for long periods of time, I\\'ll always be here if you need me. I know you\\'re confused about a lot of things that are going on in your life right now, but you know that things will eventually work out for the best. Sometimes things have to happen to make your life better. All you have to do is try not to think about the things that have gone wrong, and think about the things you\\'ve gained back since that thing went wrong. Example: Me. :D haha anyway. As I was saying, you\\'re a great guy and you deserve a great girl. You seriously deserve nothing less than the best. I know that when you give your heart to a girl you give it 100%, and if that girl can\\'t appreciate that..she doesn\\'t deserve you. I\\'ve been here for you since you were in the army with nothing to do but get on the internet and chat in vzones. I\\'ve heard about many things that have gone on in your life. One thing I\\'ve noticed about you is that you always pull through and come out of it learning something that makes you a better person. Just know that it will get easier, and you will find a girl that will make you happy. Just give it time and try not to think about the bad things. I\\'m going to end this here because I think I\\'m getting too mushy. I\\'ll talk to you tomorrow.  Love ya Steve, Alice yea, this was original. worst comment so far:  hayy ur hott i have no idea who u r though i was on a website and then saw ur pic and i clicked on it so if u ever want to talk or somthin im me on xxblondebabe77xx okay so those are the comments that I found that stood out.  Boring post sorry :) - dodgeball tournament @ 7 am (6th place out of 27) - capone  i went to mom and dads - hung out with chad and lyndsey - went to battle of the bands - boring so i played football on the beach with strangers - went back to parents house and sat for a minute - around 10 pm came home - had drama waiting for me - dealt with drama - talked to lynn for awhile - talked to alice for a minute - mike called @ 3:00 am - had to go pick his drunk ass up - back home 4:30 am - going to sleep.  pretty sure i\\'m not forgetting anything.  -latah.',\n",

If anybody has links to it pls email  urlLink memy new email address  urlLink chirag@chiragpatnaik.comKota is the place of the day, this city has the unique distinction in India to be the host for different kinds of power plants namely, Thermal, Hydroelectric and Nuclear power plants. Your\\'s truly has visited them all. This city is also in the western state of Rajasthan. It is very hot here in the Summer and almost nobody uses an Air Conditioner. This place afforded the only stability for any length of time. As I did my Class 10th 11th and 12th here. Had a generally fun time, as everybody does in the final years of school. We visited a lot of places in Rajasthan from here. Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Bharatpur(the bird sanctuary), Mathura and had almost decided to go to Delhi in the same trip but wiser counsel prevailed.I will want to go to this place, just to revive the memories of the good old days of school and the like.  Domains domains and more domains, I want moreMy posts to the blog will still be daily though erratic. This is because of me going underground to prepare for the upcoming interview in Calcutta, so I need to get in Shape and real fast that too. Anybody who has a magic bullet for weight loss may please contact  urlLink me . That\\'s all for today folks.  The next city in the current series is Allahabad. This city lies on the confluence of the three rivers the Ganges, the Yamuna and the Saraswati. However, if you pick up the Atlas, you\\'ll see that there are only two rivers. What about the  third  river? Well! it is mythological. Yes that\\'s right it\\'s Mythological. it is reputed that the river Saraswati flowed there and due to some event (I don\\'t remember what) it went underground out of shame. The rivers in India have been personified, that\\'s how the shame factor comes into the picture.Anyway back to the city, A nice city to live in. I did my class sixth and seventh here in different schools, namely the St Joseph\\'s College and The Kendriya Vidyalaya, Manauri. After this city I\\'ve always studied in Kendriya Vidyalayas(Central Schools in Hindi). Amazingly there is nothing very remarkable about this city as far as modern times go. But this city is steeped in Indian Mythology. Lord Ram is said to have been here during his 14 years of forced exile. Another feature of this place, the roots of a Banyan tree which gives of leaves(you\\'ve got to see it to believe it), the very same Banyan tree is said to be several Millenia old and the British even tried to set it afire (out of plain old Malice)so that we\\'d lose this part of our heritage, but this tree survived and is said to be one of the largest trees in India.  There is also a tunnel which is said to go all the way from Allahabad to Delhi. People have tried to follow this tunnel but it ends due to a rockfall some distance inside. I was here during the infamous Babri Masjid (Mosque) Demolition. That was one shameful aspect of India\\'s modern history, when a bunch of Hooligans decided to break down the Mosque. There was a lot of tension because of the demolition and the Army had to do Flag Marches and the like in certain localities to calm things down a bit. I was also here during the infamous Anti Mandal Commision riots. The riots took place because of the provision for reservation for the Backward classes in the Government jobs and other government owned and operated institutions. A lot of heartburn took place in this country because of that one man who was responsible for this. The amazing part is that man is alive and hopes to enter active politics again. (To dispel any confusion it was not Mr Mandal, But Prime Minister VP singh who actually implemented the commision report and is thus reviled for the reason).  I probably will never want to come back here again, simply because there is nothing to come back to.And the Indian TimeZone in Blogger still does not work.  I\\'m registering domain by the dozen, u\\'r right I\\'ve nothing better to do.  hI\\'ve made  a new graphic for u ppl to link to.urlLink  I\\'m sick of looking for travel quotes for a round trip to the US. I was looking for the cheapest one available, but no luck so far. I\\'m playing rinra-ringa-roses and they send me from one place to another. Why am i looking for a round trip ticket to the US? Cause my Mum has to go towards June this year. and what about me? not for another 10 years at least.  PS If anybody can help me, please email  urlLink me . with quotes of flights, to New York from Bombay (or Mumbai) on the first sunday of June and returning around the the second week of August (yah, a very long time).  Today\\'s city is Srinagar, to those who haven\\'t heard of Srinagar, it is the Summer Capital of Jammu and Kashmir, with Jammu being the Winter Capital. It is not a very hospitable place now, due to the activity of Pakistani Terrorists in the Valley. It is now a non family station for people like My father meaning families of Defence Personnel and the like are not allowed there. Srinagar is famous for its Gardens by the Mughal Emperors of India in the Medeival ages, and also the Houseboats on the Dal Lake. House Boats are just that Houses on Boats, and are now used as tourist hotels. Correction,  were  used as tourist hotels, due to the activity of Pakistani Terrorists, no tourists. Not only bad for tourism but also for the local people, as tourism is the mainstay of the local economy.There will be sometime before normalcy returns, but it is unlikely as the Pakistani Government survives on Pure Hate. If India vanishes tommorow the whole country of Pakistan will collapse. or maybe not they already have America to hate and Russia and...  the city of the day coming up in a couple of hours  I rated 75 out of 100 on the  urlLink suave-o-meter .  It says:  You are quite the Casanova! You know how to play the dating game, and you\\'re damn good at it! Most likely, you are a woman magnet and you are never without an admirer. It appears that you have an incredible amount of charm, and your attentive and sensitive demeanor makes you irresistible. You have definitely been taught well. You know how to treat a woman, and you make sure that she feels special and appreciated by yours truly. You have a knack for expressing yourself and showing your interest, without looking too eager. That is a difficult balancing act, and you deserve a pat on the back for perfecting it. At the rate you\\'re going, you won\\'t be dating much longer before you score your dream girl!I don\\'t have a girlfriend, and with my looks never will too. I decided to add a few blogs on my page, then I realised that my blog would come (if at all) on other peoples blogs way down in the bottom, so I\\'ve decided to change the name of my blog to  A Blog Formerly Known As My Ramblings and Rants . hahahah I\\'m  Invincible . I may not be original, but I\\'m invincible.urlLink Tracy  dropped a line saying I\\'m a lazy bum (not quite) haha. she actually asked which blogs were abusive.

You might also be interested to know that this place lies in the Kashmir Valley is right on the LoC with Pakistan. So sensitive is this place that one is not allowed to use crackers for  Diwali . A nice place to visit for a while but horrible place to stay. a lot of picnic spots next to mountain streams and brooks, and also a lot of hiking trails, camping out is really fun here. There is no animal threat of anykind except for the occasional Leopard and the like.  Last Words: Nice place wish I could visit every Year, Unfortunately can\\'t because of Pakistani Terrorists which makes this a non family station. Maybe in a century hence it\\'ll be peaceful again, till then sigh  today\\'s town will have to wait for another couple of hours.  For those who cam ein late, I\\'m doing a series of writeups on the towns and cities I\\'ve visited over the past fifteen years.

Stinger missiles in Pakistan? well they were supplied with gay abandon to the Afgani\\'s during the Afganistan war. and now are in the hands of the Pakistani terrorists.  The best part is yet to come. The CIA tried to buy back the Stingers, then they said they\\'d pay for photographs of the broken stingers. yes ppl it\\'s all true, it\\'s all happening here, the most happening place on this planet.  The  Nuclear flashpoint in this world.  Todays town is Nasirabad. this town is in the Western state of Rajasthan, this place is extremely hot in the summers and has a perenial water shortage. Nearby places of interest include Ajmer which has the Dargah(shrine) of someone famous (forgot who it was). it is rumoured the emperor Akbar himself had come here and had had his prayers fulfilled. I did class 2 and 3 here, in Battle Axe Montessori and the St. Anslem\\'s School. Last words Okay place, absolutely no crime and I don\\'t wanna go there again, ever..  new look to my site and blog, hope u like it. The old look was ripped of  urlLink Tarsh\\'s  Blog.

Well! I\\'m looking for a place to study. I\\'ll be also going to calcutta in the Second week of April. Why? this time for a job. (I call it a paid holiday)  The next place I\\'m writing about is Wellington, no it is not the Wellington you\\'re thinking of. This Wellington is in the Southern Indian state of Tamil nadu, My father was here for his Staff College Course at the Defence Services Staff College. This place too served as a jump of point visit several Southern Indian cities like Mysore, Chennai (Madras) and the like. The hill station Oooty is just a stones throw away from here. There are two ways to get to Wellington. One is to take a bus from the nearest Railhead Coimbatore, and the other is to take the toy train, just joking, it\\'s actually a metre gauge train which has a third rail in between the two tracks to provide traction while climbing the steep hill sides. again a very Picturesque location. I did Class 1 and half of Class 2 here, we had stayed here for only 1 year. I studied in a school called the Holy Angels. The year of stay 1985.Last words: A very sleepy town, absolutely no crime, ideal retirement home, I could live here, in 50 years time  Did you people hear, Windows (primitive version) source code has been leaked, I\\'m looking for it, if nebody knows where, please mail me. I want it, I want it. Why? you ask. Obviously so that I can be the next Bill gates, hehehehe  The first place I\\'m writing about is a place called Yol Camp, This town is based on a hillside in the Kangra district in the state of Himachal Pradesh. This place is near Dhramsala, which more famous due to the the Tibetan Government in exile. I\\'ve lived in this town twice, the first time when Iwas doing kindergarten, and then more recently in class 8th and 9th. I remember a few things from my first stay. I used to go to a school called the Sacred Heart School, which is about 8 KM away from Yol. And the other time I studied in Kendriya Vidalaya (Central School).This place has a lot of temples around it. This place also served as a jump of point to visit other cities and towns in North India, like Pathankot, Jammu, Vaishno Devi(a very big pilgrimage spot). A very picturesque locale. As the whole town is based on the hillside, and the roads up the hill are inclined at a 70 degree angle, and is wont to happen, a lot of accidents take place.Last words: A very Sleepy Town, absolutely no crime, ideal retirement home (let me otta here)  I will be puting up daily reviews of the places I\\'ve visited over the last 15 years, since I don\\'t remember anything previous to that(I\\'m 20). I\\'ll be posting to the blog first and the same will be availablke thru links on my website. It\\'ll give some continuity to the blog and something for me to post everyday.

My first post to my blog,  Those Paki\\'s (Pakistanis)ought to be fried in hot oil, maybe even roasted in the warm glow of Nuclear radiation.In brief the rant is as follows: Pakistan (a country with delusions of grandeur) claims that Kashmir is a part of their country, when actually it is part of mine. Their (The Pakis) country has been a breeding ground for terrorists like a piece of rotten wood is a breeding ground for Fungus. I believe that the Western media has still not emerged from their cold war mindset, is shown by the fact that whatever India does is a Human rights violation and whatever the terrorists do are legitimate acts towards freedom. Also seen in their attitude in Chechnya. When the Russians bombed that place to oblivion, it was a gross violation of Human rights, when Americans and the rest did the same in Yugoslavia it was a fight for the good of mankind (certainly not that of the Yugoslavians)  Do hungry people a favour click on this link  urlLink The Hunger Site  Have decided to implement a new navigation system for my website which is located at  urlLink http://india.4mg.com .

My favourite place of the lot is Pune. This maybe so because I did my graduation here and lived here foir two years in a hostel.I visit this place once in a couple of months, the fact that this place is only 4 hrs away also helps. A very very nice place to live in, I\\'d like to live here, if I I get a job or something like that. This place is a 4 hour train ride from Bombay, and a retirement city so to speak. though it is changing for the better now. It is more and more becoming a young persons city, somewhat like Bangalore.  God I love this city, wish I could stay here for ever.  The city of the day coming up in two hours  That\\'s all folks for today  From the West of the Country I went all the way to the North East. The next city I lived in was Guahati. This city is the largest in the entire North Eastern Part of India. It has a very famous temple called the Kamakhya which has been filthly maintained. Also famous in this region is the Assam Silk Saree, which was exported by my Mother to all her relatives all over the country and abroad. We went to several places in Assam and the neighbouring states. Some of the places we went to were Cherapunji(Highest Rainfall in the world). We also went to the Kaziranga National park, famous for the One Horned Rhino. Generally an okay city if you can put up with the people who cannot speak English or Hindi properly and not to mention the fact, that they invariably mispronounce your name. An interesting superstition is that  you cannot leave Assam unless you have crossed the Bramhaputra at least seven times. If you do leave before you have done so, you are destined to come back. I don\\'t think I want to go back to this place again simply because there is nothing to go back to or for.  My net connection expired so no blogging.

Which means our host will probably cease to exist ina  few months time... which makes me wonder as to what happens to my agency? 25% of which is now owned by WPP, and the rest is owned by WPP\\'s arch (and bigger) rival Publicis... the word that comes to mind is B...... :|  that the agency parentages are somewhat complicated is an understatement...

Of course. and it varies differently for different categories. As a broad and general statement for print, advertising peaks in October, with an immediate fall in November. For the rest of the year it is more or less at a stable level, except for a slight dip in Feb, April and July.Of course there is also the fact that there will be individual variations for different categories... woollens, cars, computers for obvious reasons.  Then there are special events like the world cup, which would bring about huge swells in spends. This last world cup showed a monitored swell of 50% on print... amazing is the only word I can think ofurlLink INDIAN LINKS  was one of my earlier efforts at websites.

Who asked me to put down some thoughts on how I see things on the internet shaping up. While I did put down those thoughts, I never actually sent it to him, the file was lying around till I came across it a couple of days back.  Here is a rewrite of what I initially penned down (typed up?).A lot of rambling about nothing in particular. The positioning of a product or service is more and more targeted to more and more specific audiences? Case in point are the BMW and Mercedes, both are from fine German engineering pedigree, both are premium luxury cars. However the buyers of the two will probably as different as two people can be. The former will be bought by a person who will drive the car himself and the latter probably by someone who has a chauffer (Yes, I know Mercedes also makes sports cars\\x85 this is the general perception that I expressed here). Such a huge differentiation in mindset is what branding is all about. This trend is seen in media as well. The rise of niche publications in developed economies such as the US and UK is illustrative of this.Any media would broadly undergo the distinct phases of consolidation in the growth phase and then  fragmentation once the medium matures. The internet is perhaps one medium which fragmented even before it matured. This is perhaps explained by the global reach of the media and the fact that ideas can be easily replicated across geographical  political boundaries; i.e. something that works in America, will almost certainly not work in India, simply because the maturity of the American market is of a different order of magnitude. To illustrate this point further the existence and flourishing of sites like epinions.com (in the American context) and the apparent non-starter of the Indian equivalent mouthshut.com which are sources of information.  Or price comparison sites like mySimon.com which as far as I know has no comparable Indian site.With this brief background, it would be instrumental to see the whole internet game in a different perspective . The internet tends to promote the formation of groups of people with very specific interests. A sort of mother of all niche publications, which you can talk back to and what\\x92s more it talks back to you and allows you to communicate with your peer group.While the Bennet philosophy has been to be an aggregator of audiences by subsidizing the price the audience pays to retrieve content and then retrieving profit from the purchasing those audiences. This can prove counter productive as far as the Internet goes, as the internet has people who are used to getting content for free and are likely to freeload. On the other hand the audience which does pay to retrieve the content would then be most prized and wanted by an advertiser, if nothing to prove non frivolousness of their transaction with us. The idea would be to convince the mass populace that information is of value. The easiest way to ensure that is to look for focused verticals in the information segment. The first one that comes to mind is economictimes.com or more accurately perhaps the work of ETIG.The biggest problem that one can make out is how will people pay for it online. Multimodal payment mechansims are already in use by the Indiatimes family of websites. Virtual currency of some kind can perhaps be also created for this purpose.What about the business we are in? Content can take several forms, one of the forms could be that of blogs (such as the one you are reading right now). Blogs are the latest rage in America, now spreading to other parts of the world. Blogs are nothing but a personal running commentary on the world in general and sometimes specific to a topic.Another form could be in the form of reviews. Reviews can be on any topic, from the palces to party  eat out in Delhi to where to find the best shoes in Chandini Chowk. Ineractivity which needs to be the cornerstone of such an offering. Such content may well be in the form of a blog.Traditional content in the form of newspapers, TV, Radio will definitely migrate in one form or the other to the web. Evolution of devices like the Microsoft Tablet PC or the Handspring Treo are definitely a step in that direction.In that respect standardisation under one name a la indiatimes.com is probably the biggest single mistake being undertaken by us and many others across the world. This conclusion is based on our initial premise that internet promotes the formation of specific focus groups. By definition these focus groups would be unlikey to turn to a general interest portal to get their kicks so to speak. The creation of multiple brands would be a better branding and strategic idea, having a ghoomnahai.com rather than having something like Indiatimes Travel. This gives an identity to the content and makes it more valued by its consumers.The above, when seen in the overall context of evolution of media, is a perfectly logical sequence of events. Growing media consolidates, and then fragments. During the growth phase it is perfectly acceptable to have a single brand name, but the moment the medium matures (maybe in the context of the limited audience it gathers in the Indian scenario)Show me the money!!!Whether people will pay to read ( someday in the future see) such content is debatable. The likes of Al Ries would have us believe that advertising will never work on the internet (which is something I disagree with strongly). So what will happen? Will the internet become a subversive medium which will undermine modern society as we know it. A sort of a no man\\x92s land where no content will be paid for? products and services being the only ones able to draw any sort of revenue?\\x93The Truth\\x94 as the immortal words form \\x91X Files\\x92 go \\x93is out there..\\x94.  My personal suspicion is that heavily prized content a la NYT or WSJ will not only be paid for, but will also attract significant advertising revenues. For the rest, creation of strong niches will allow them to do the same\\x85PS: Don\\'t hesitate to comment...  I got a job offer today... ad sales... hmmm...

It also marks the beginning of the new year and is celebrated with the lighting of lamps. Diwali or Deepawali, literally \\'an array of lamps\\', is the festival of lights and is celebrated on the darkest night of Kartik. It is perhaps the most important festival in India. Originally a Hindu festival, it has now crossed the bounds of religion and is celebrated by all in India with fervor and gaiety. This day is a public holiday all over India.  Twinkling oil lamps or diyas light up every home and firework displays are common all across the country. The goddess Lakshmi (consort of Vishnu), who is the symbol of wealth and prosperity, is also worshipped on this day. This festive occasion also marks the beginning of the Hindu new year and Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed god, the symbol of auspiciousness and wisdom, is also worshipped in most Hindu homes on this day.  Another view is that Deepawali is meant to celebrate the destruction of the arrogant tyrant Bali at the hands of Vishnu when the latter appeared in his Vamana (dwarf) avatar. The occasion of Deepawali sees the spring-cleaning and white-washing of houses; decorative designs or rangolis are painted on floors and walls. New clothes are bought and family members and relatives gather together to offer prayers, distribute sweets and to light up their homes.Diwali is also perhaps the oldest festival still celebrated today and is mentioned in the Ramayana. The celebrations include the lighting of lamps and candles, and the bursting of crackers (fireworks). Friends and neighbours exchange special sweets. People buy new clothes and in fact, in certain communities, it is absolutely essential to wear new clothes on this day.  Diwali in India is equivalent to Christmas in the West. Therefore it is also the time when people get the festival bonus to their salaries. It marks the beginning of the new year for a large majority of Hindus, especially the trader community.  Preparations for the festival begin many days prior to Diwali. It is time for a thorough cleaning of the house, for the belief is that Lakshmi will enter clean and nicely decorated houses. The scientific reason is that the monsoon is a time for insects and fungus to breed.With the end of the monsoon, homes need to be cleaned and painted, and belongings aired and dried before the onset of winter. The festival itself extends over about a week even though the most important day is the new moonday.  In east Bihar and northern India, two days before Diwali is celebrated as Dhanteras in honour of Dhanvantari, the physician of the gods. He is believed to have emerged with a pot of amrita during the samudra manthan. People bathe early in the morning and observe a fast, which is broken only after sunset with sweetmeats, puri and other delicacies. On Dhanteras, new kitchen utensils are bought and kept at the place of worship. The buying of utensils, according to one theory, relates to the myth of Dhanvantari emerging from the ocean with a pot in his hand. Since he is also the physician of the gods, cleanliness and hygiene are essential to this festival. The day before Diwali is celebratedas Choti Diwali or \\'small Diwali\\'. It is Diwali on a smaller scale, with fewer lights lit and fewer crackers burst.  The morning after Choti Diwali, the women of the house make beautiful, coloured rangoli in the doorway and courtyard. Tiny footprints made out of rice paste are a special feature of the rangolis made for Diwali. They signify the footprints of Lakshmi, as she enters the house. In Hindu homes, Diwali celebrations involve a ritual puja to Lakshmi and also to Rama in the evening. Songs in honour of the gods are sung and arati is performed. Oil or ghee diyas are also lit. The gods are offered kheel, batashe and khilone and various sweetmeats. After the puja, the diyas are placed in and around the house: in the doorway, near the Tulasi plant, the backyard, every room and the back and front gates. After this, crackers are burst, and people meet friends and neighbours to exchange good wishes and sweets. Since Diwali falls on the new moon night, lamps are lit to brighten this moonless night. According to a myth, Lakshmi will not enter a dark house. The lamps also welcome home the spirits of dead ancestors, who are believed to visit on this auspicious night. In addition, the light frightens away any evil spirit that might be wandering about near the house on this night. In Orissa, lamps are lit to light up the dark path that the spirits of ancestors take back to heaven. In modern times, ghee diyas have been replaced by wax candles and coloured electric bulbs. In many areas, there is a competition of sorts among neighbours as everyone tries to have the brightest lights. The origin of Diwali can be traced back to ancient India, when it was probably an important harvesting season. It was thus extremely important to the largely pastoral Vaishya community. Their granaries were full, and the weather was good, at the end of the long monsoon and before the arduous winter. It was therefore a good time to celebrate. The Vaishya community began their new year with this happy occassion, after paying their debts and clearing their ledgers. As the religion developed, various mythological stories and explanations were attributedto this festival to give it religious sanction.  However today, this historical explanation is all but lost among the many stories and folklore linked with the origin of the festival. According to the most popular one, Diwali is celebrated in honour of Rama, his consort Sita and brother Lakshmana, returning to their kingdom Ayodhya after a 14-year exile.To celebrate this event, people at Ayodhya are believed to have lit up their houses with lamps. The illuminations also symbolise the removal of spiritual darkness and the onset of happiness and prosperity. According to another belief, it is on this day that Lakshmi emerged from the ocean during the samudra manthan .Lakshmi Puja commemorates her birth and therefore forms a major part of Diwali celebrations. Being associated with the goddess of wealth and fortune, Diwali is specially important to the Vaishyacommunity. Most tradesmen close their old ledgers and dealings and start afresh with new ledgers after Diwali. This day, with its emphasis on money, is also considered lucky for gambling. Giving social sanction to a vice, a popular saying states that one who does not gamble on this day will beborn a donkey in his next birth. Casinos and local gambling houses do brisk business during the Diwali week. In most homes, people invite their friends and relatives over to play cards.Another reason for the celebration of Diwali is that it marks the killing of the evil Narkasura at the hands of Krishna Naraka is believed to have abducted 16,000 women. Krishna killed him and rescued these women whom he later married. Naraka is the personification of hell and is believed to be the monsoon during which all activities come to a standstill.Though Diwali is equally important in the south and the north, the celebrations are markedly different. In South India, the story widely associated with Diwali is that of Narasimha, the man-lion incarnation of Vishnu. According to a legend, Hiranyakshipu was an evil demon king. He was unjust and cruel to his people. However, he was almost invincible, having extracted a boon from Brahma that he would be killed neither by beast nor man, neither inside nor outside, neither during the day nor at night. When his atrocities became unbearable, the gods sought Vishnu\\'s help. Assuming his fifth incarnation of Narasimha, the man-lion,Vishnu killed Hiranyakshipu with his claws in the courtyard just before day break, hence steering clear of the boundaries of the boon. For this reason in the south, people light diyas in their houses on the day preceding Diwali. The next day begins early. First is the ritual bath, which begins with an oil massage of the hair and body. This is absolutely essential on this day. Its importance probably refers to cleaning oneself thoroughly after the monsoon months. After bathing, people receive new clothes and gifts from their elders, which they are expected to wear. The family then prays to Vishnu for its well-being and prosperity. After the prayers start the main celebrations which, as in the north, consist of bursting crackers and lighting candles.At day break, all celebrations end.People then visit friends and relatives and exchange sweets.References to the word \\'atishbaji\\' or\\'crackers\\' are found even in ancient literature. The bursting of crackers is today the most important and eagerly-awaited part of the Diwali celebrations. According to one belief, the sound that resounds throughout the universe makes all aware of the great homecoming of Rama. Another belief is that the crackers are an indication ofthe joy of the people living on the earth, making the gods aware of their plentiful state. Still another possible reason has a more scientific basis: the fumes produced by the crackers kill a lot of insects, found in plenty after the rains. The use of high-tech bomb crackers is fairly recent. At times, Diwali celebrations get ugly, especially in the metropolitan cities. In New Delhi, people start bursting crackers in the evening and this continues till the early hours ofthe morning. As a result, the city is engulfed in toxic fumes and smoke for almost 10 hours. Another problem with crackers is that their manufacture is usually unregulated. As a result, the manufacturing units are unsafe and the material used is inflammable and toxic.Every year, many units are destroyed inaccidental fires, resulting in the death of those employed there.Kerala is probably the only state in India where even Hindus do not celebrate Diwali. The major festival there is Onam. In West Bengal, Kali Puja is performed on Diwali as it is believed that on this day Kali killed the wicked Raktavija. Being one of the main festivals of the trader community, markets are gaily decorated and lit up. Many safety measures and precautions are telecast on television and radio, especially for children. The fire departments are kept on the alert, and the municipal corporations of bigger cities also organise buckets and tankers of water at strategic locations. The second day after Diwali is celebrated as Bhai Duja when sisters apply tilak to their brothers and pray for their long and happy life. In all likelihood, this ritual was originally intended only for married women. Since they celebrated Diwali with their in-laws, this festival allowed them to come to their parents\\' home during this auspicious time. They got some time to meet the family and to rest after the hectic activity of the preceding week.And it gave their parents an opportunity to give them gifts, an opportunity they did not often get. Nowadays however, among many communities Bhai Duja is observed by both married and unmarried sisters.urlLink http://webonautics.com/ethnicindia/festivals/diwali.htmlI have been running  urlLink Google Compute  for some weeks now...

While this is worrying to Nokia Nokia is itself digging it\\'s own grave...  How?For years, Nokia phones were known for their simplicity and ease of use, and admittedly by the top execs of hte company that the proprietary interface on their hones had a lot to do with it... Howver the newer Nokias are using the Symbian Series 60 based OS. Which means that the interface is no longer the key distinguishing factor between the different brands of phones.  This coupled with the earlier insight would mean an ever weaking technological position which has been Nokia\\'s marketing pitch in the past. The oft repeated statement in any marketing course as to Technology no longer being a differentiator, but a leveller, will be true for Nokia.This  Wired  story on cracking of the Nokia N-Gage Games to be run on other Series 60 OS phones (Siemens), illustrates the point above..

For almost 40 years we have all been subscribing to a simple dogma about the growth of the information age: progress means making more and more computing power available at lower and lower prices. Back in 1965 Gordon Moore laid out his famous law that the number of components that could be squeezed on to a silicon chip would double every year or two. Now everybody can buy a laptop computer with the computing power that entire nations were aspiring to in the 1970s.  Moore\\x92s law still has a long future. But in 2004 the belief that progress means packing in ever more computing power will be seen as far too narrow. Just arriving is another kind of information revolution, driven by the ability to manufacture billions of tiny, intelligent communicating sensors. Capable of organising themselves into networks, intelligent sensors will make up for their small brains by their immense numbers.urlLink LinkDon\\'t want to register for to read or use a website visit  urlLink bugmenot.com  via  urlLink Digital Deliverance  urlLink LinkTalk about crazy inventions...

This is a true story, or so I have been led to believe. It was told to the mutant by his friend \"Jack\". Jack related the story to me during our discussion of the mental illness we have all come to know as \"flag worship\".  I should mention that my friend Jack is an accomplished liar, given to exaggeration of details, so he may have made it all up on the spot.  Jack is a mechanic. He works for a company that owns a fleet of vehicles and heavy equipment. He keeps the machinery running and he likes his job. Jack is fighting terrorism his way.  A few days before the anniversary of 9/11, Jack was approached by his employer with a nice new American flag.  \"Jack, I just bought a flag.\"  Jack peered at the nice new clean flag from beneath a layer of grease and dirt, \"I am happy for you. What does this mean to me?\"  \"You are the mechanic,\" says the employer, in the way that employers do when what they are saying flys solidly into the face of logic. \"Can you build us a flagpole?\"  \"Yeah, I suppose I could. But it will take time away from working on our vehicles. I am not doing this on my own time.\"  \"Of course.\"  And so, Jack set off to build a flagpole. Jack is a mechanic mind you, he is not a flagpole engineer. He has other things to do, important things that generate income for his company. But he got on with it anyway.  Jack computed the availability of basic materials on hand, those that had to be purchased, the location selected for the pole atop the building, the size of the flag, how much time this project would detract from his regular cash-producing duties, lightning, low-flying aircraft, rabid bats, what he could get away with, and so forth. Based on these figures, Jack produced a flagpole atop the office. Old Glory fluttered in the breeze. Sighting it from the relative safety of his garage, Jack puffed with satisfaction on his Marlboro.  But all was not well my friends. No. For as we shall see, a horrible sickness began to take hold of the office workers.  In the vocabulary of flagpole engineers, people whose life work is the study of upright cylinders crowned with a loop of rope and and pulleys and the ability of said structures to loft a brightly colored cloth into high visibily, Jack\\'s flagpole was \\'half-assed\\', a first year student\\'s attempt at an art form best left to professionals. The office dwellers complained to Jack that when there was little wind, a tiny bit of the drooping colors scraped against the roof, fraying the edge of the flag.  \"It\\'s not that bad,\" says Jack. \"No one can see that, it still looks OK.\"  \"It\\'s a brand new flag. It has to come down until you make the pole higher,\" says the employer.  \"That will cost more money and more time. An extension will have to be added to the pole. And I will have to build a new bracket.\"  \"That\\'s fine, do whatever you need to do.\"  And so Jack removed the flagpole from the roof, built a new bracket to hold an extension, and remounted the pole to the roof. Satisfied with his work, Jack returned to his garage to find something really greasy and dirty and profitable to work on.  The flagpole looked good, the office dwellers all agreed, and they cheered Jack\\'s accomplishment, they glowed with patriotism, and the sickness, moved in with them.  \"Jack, can you mount some lights under the flag so it can be seen it at night?\"  \"Who is that going to impress?\" says Jack from behind a cloud of smoke that was once a flagpole-like cylinder of selected fine tobacco.  \"What?\" The sickness affects hearing first. \"We should have lights shine on our flagpole. Can you do that?\"  I\\'ll kill this shit thinks Jack, \"Yeah, but we should really have our electrician do that sort of work.\"  \"That\\'s OK.\"  \"Is it? The electrician has to come out of the city. It will cost more time and more money.\"  The increasingly larger dollar signs had still not yet registered in the employer\\'s brain, \"Money is not the issue. Do whatever you need to do.\"  Jack contacted the electrician and an appointment was set. In the meantime, high winds during a storm broke the bracket and sent the top half of the pole, flag and all, crashing down to the roof. A mournful wail erupted from the sickened office workers. The peaceful nastiness of Jack\\'s garage was once again shattered.  Jack\\'s employer gave up on the whole project, by passing the responsiblity on to the office manager. By this time, the sickness was in full bloom. The office worker\\'s need for the flag had grown beyond normal boundaries. It was the crack-pipe of patriotism, around which they all rallied. They needed more.  The office manager confronted Jack, \"We want to erect a new flagpole. How soon can you get it up there?\"  \"Look, as long as we keep mounting it to the roof it\\'s going to be a problem. We will have to weld it. Our welder will have to weld the poles and we\\'ll have to mount it on the roof very securely. We are talking about a very difficult job, more money, more time, and it will continue to be a problem. We need to bail on this deal. This flag is a bad idea. It has been nothing but trouble.\"  The manager conveyed the news to the office workers, but the sickness was undeterred. They decided to instead erect the pole in the front parking lot. And they still wanted lights to shine up on the flag.  And so it was that Jack removed the flagpole and sought out the assistance of the welder, who is a marine corps veteran.  An interesting side-note, the welder is eighty years old, he was told by a gypsy fortune-teller when he was a child that he would die on his twenty-first birthday. This is no problem he thought, I just won\\'t be anywhere dangerous on that day. But the welder was a marine, and as fate would have it, on his twenty-first birthday, he was face-down on the beach at Okinawa, with bombs and machine-gun bullets and parts of bodies flying all around him, and all he could think about was that fucking gypsy. He\\'s done his part for his country. And now he has to deal with sick people who cannot begin to guess at what patriotism really is.  The welder agrees to help out, but new materials are needed. The poles Jack has been using on the roof won\\'t do.  Being a veteran, he points out that if they erect a pole of this kind, the flag must be raised in the morning and lowered in the evening. It must then be folded into a triangle. And what\\'s more, because the flag has touched the ground, it has been desecrated, and must be burned.  Jack thinks this is fine idea. Jack thinks that this is the best idea he has heard in a long time. Indeed, burning the flag, this flag, would give him a positive hard-on. His brain erupts in visions of the flag and the office building consumed with flames, workers running to and fro within, helpless, unable to escape, and himself, watching from his garage, reassembling a carburetor, whistling a happy gospel tune.  Jack is on his way to the trash burning spot with the flag in one hand and a can of kerosene in the other, the word goes out across the yard, and the crew rushes to stop him.  The welder goes on to explain that the flag cannot simply be burned in order to cast out the evil spirits. No. They must take the flag to the VFW Hall. There they will arrange a ceremony complete with uniforms, guns, a bugler to play taps, a chaplain, an altar, a pentagram, a virgin girl scout to sacrifice, and so on. Flag burning, as with flag ownership, and flag display, implies a lot of silly-assed rules and ceremonies so it seems.  The welder took the flag with him to the VFW Hall, so if you don\\'t get the girl scout cookies you ordered this year, now you know why. Sickness takes a toll.  Soon thereafter, Jack is called into an office meeting. He stubbs his cigarette out at the door before entering, but he keeps it, unlit, dangling out of his mouth. Jack is particularly greasy today, approaching pure nasty. As he takes his seat among his co-workers, he is the portrait of someone who whose time is being wasted at faster-than-light speed.  \"What is this all about? I\\'m busy,\" he grumbles.  \"We need to decide who is going to raise and lower the flag,\" says the office manager.  \"What flag?\"  \"This is important. We need to decide how this will be handled.\"  \"Do I have this right? I had to stop working to come into a meeting to decide who will raise the flag that we do not have on the flagpole that we also do not have?\"  The office manager can\\'t take it anymore, \"Can I see you in here for a moment?\"  They go into a private office.  \"Geez Jack, what are you a communist?\"  \"No. I am a nazi.\"  \"Oh God, Jack, don\\'t say things like that. People don\\'t think that kind of talk is funny.\"  \"Ja, I am really.\"  \"Look Jack, it\\'s just a little flag.\"  \"No. If I have a little flag on a wooden stick,\" waving his unlit cigarette to demonstrate, \"That is a little flag. You are holding a meeting for something that does not exist. I have a transmission scattered out across the garage in ten-thousand pieces that has to be reassembled and working to do a job at eight AM tomorrow that will make money for the company which is what we are all here to do.\"  \"I get it, OK. Go.\"  And go he did. The manager returned to the meeting, \"I don\\'t know. I guess he\\'s just un-patriotic...\"  Indeed. I am Jack\\'s complete lack of patriotism.  The sickness swept across the company, and with it now came the labels, \"Jack is un-american. Jack is a communist. Must be a democrat. Child abuse, I heard. A satanist...\" They just could not understand it. Why would anyone hate the flag so much?  Thou shalt have no other god before me. Unless it\\'s the flag. Amen.  Jack is approached by his employer, who has quite wrongly determined that he can bring Jack back into the fold. Jack decides to snap his boss back into reality.  \"How much money have you spent on this flag deal?\"  \"Well, the flag was a hundred dollars.\"  \"And you have paid me over two days wages to deal with the flag.\"  The boss can\\'t believe this, \"It can\\'t be that much.\" Sick people can\\'t count.  \"Go figure.\"  He did. The boss figures he has spent almost four-hundred dollars on a flagpole that he does not have, for a flag that he does not have. Isn\\'t that special?  Now. The electrician. Remember the electrician? The electrician has arrived to put lights on the roof to shine up on the flag, the flag that isn\\'t there, on the flagpole, that also isn\\'t there.  Jack had fun explaining to the electrician that there was not, in fact, any flagpole, and that the flag had, in fact, been burned in some bizarre ritual at the VFW Hall. He also advised him that if these people didn\\'t get a new flag soon there might be trouble, so he should watch his ass.  The office manager had fun trying to explain where the flagpole would be, and where the lights that will shine up on the flag will go. Since they did not know how high the pole would be, the lights had to be highly adjustable. He also asked the electrician to put a timer on the lights since it was determined in yet another office meeting that nobody wanted to be bothered to turn the lights on and off manually, let alone raise and lower the flag. Sickness causes laziness.  The electrician had fun presenting his estimate for the work that had to be done. And in descibing how much of the the lot must be dug up to install pipes to carry the wires to power the lights. No doubt, he also had fun telling his co-workers about these hillbillies he went out to give an estimate to that day.  Since the company had its own equipment for digging ditches, all the electrician had to do at this point was mark out where the pipes would be laid, avoiding gas lines, phone lines, and so on, and return when they were ready.  Enter the boss\\'s idiot son.  The boss\\'s son has never operated a ditcher. But since this work was on company property, now was his opportunity to learn. Are you getting ahead of me yet?  So he\\'s running the ditcher. Once it starts it\\'s pretty well automatic and only needs to be turned when neccessary. Jack and his co-workers note that the little boss is coloring outside the lines a bit.  \"The line turns back there,\" Jack yells over the machine noise, \"Don\\'t you need to turn the ditcher now?\"  \"Yeah, I\\'m going to turn it over here, in a minute.\"  Jack knew better and walked over to the ditcher to turn it. Just then, there was a flash of light and a hell of a noise. Sparks and pipes and wiring shot out of the ditch.  The power goes out at the office, and the apartment complex next door, and the convienience store and the strip center nearby. The phones aren\\'t working either. No cable tv. And all eight-hundred feet of the DSL fiber-optic cable, all the way back to the junction box, has been ripped out and wrapped around the ditcher\\'s impeller.Now, power and phone services are easy enough to repair, but the DSL cannot easily be fixed. The repairmen do not know where the pipes are exactly, so, for two weeks they dig ditches up and down both sides of the road looking for them. And then a few days more while they dry out the pipes with nitrogen.  Meanwhile, the company cannot do billing because the DSL is down, (don\\'t ask me why). So, no money coming in.  The computer guy resorts to stealing the modem out of Jack\\'s computer, the only one with a modem, to build a proxy and get everyone back online.  Once the crisis had passed, Jack inquired of his employer what the situation with the flag was. Jack is funny that way.  \"Fuck that flag,\" the boss said.  It is estimated that the company was now into the flag for over three-thousand dollars.  Three-thousand dollars. For a flag they didn\\'t have. On a flagpole they also didn\\'t have.  Is there a point to my story? Well, fuck if I know, you people expect a lot when you click that little mouse don\\'t you?  We were talking about sickness. When illness stikes, the body tries to expell it however it can. Sneeze it out, cough it out, sweat it out.  The mental illness of \"flag worship\" is different. Only a really good beating will get it out of your system.  Well anyway, that\\'s Jack\\'s prescription.  ---The Happy Ending---  Jack was going through some old toolboxes and found a set of stickers. He went through the office passing them out.  \"One for you, and one for you...\" he sang as he went along.  He reached the office manager with the last one, \"And one for you...\"  \"All right! I know just where to put it,\" said the office manager, slapping the American flag sticker on the side of his computer monitor. \"That\\'s great!\"  Indeed it was.

If he tries to take advantage of some of the known weaknesses in Google\\'s semi-secret algorithms, he may find himself penalized by Google, and his traffic disappears. There are no detailed, published standards issued by Google, and there is no appeal process for penalized sites. Google is completely unaccountable. Most of the time they don\\'t even answer email from webmasters.\"Yes indeed, most of the traffic on my website comes from Google searches, this is a bad thing?

A military coup has taken place in the United States--the year is 2012--and General Thomas E. T. Brutus, Commander-in-Chief of the Unified Armed Forces of the United States, now occupies the White House as permanent Military Plenipotentiary. His position has been ratified by a national referendum, though scattered disorders still prevail and arrests for acts of sedition are underway.  A senior retired officer of the Unified Armed Forces, known here simply as Prisoner 222305759, is one of those arrested, having been convicted by court-martial for opposing the coup. Prior to his execution, he is able to smuggle out of prison a letter to an old War College classmate discussing the \"Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012.\" In it, he argues that the coup was the outgrowth of trends visible as far back as 1992. These trends were the massive diversion of military forces to civilian uses, the monolithic unification of the armed forces, and the insularity of the military community. His letter survives and is here presented verbatim.  It goes without saying (I hope) that the coup scenario above is purely a literary device intended to dramatize my concern over certain contemporary developments affecting the armed forces, and is emphatically not a prediction. -- The AuthorurlLink America\\'s military coup  \"...if there\\'s a sentiment in the army it is: Support Our Troops, Impeach Rumsfeld\".

              " '  The history of seitans origin and different ways to prepare the seitan.Seitan (say-TAHN) is made from gluten. Gluten is the name of the insoluble protein in wheat, probably most familiar as the stuff that makes bread dough elastic. Known as Seitan in Japan, as kofu in China, and as \"wheat meat\" and \"gluten\" here in the U.S., seitan is a low fat, high protein, firm-textured meat substitute. It has been eaten in China, Japan, Korea, Russia and the Middle East for thousands of years. Gluten is often referred to in Chinese restaurants as \"Buddha food\", because of the claim that it was developed by pacifist, vegetarian Buddhist monks as a meat substitute. It is a food rich in tradition as well as nutrition.As a protein source, seitan contains about 31 grams of protein per 4 ounce serving (which means it has more plant protein per serving than tofu), provides a modest amount of B vitamins and iron and contains no saturated fat or cholesterol. A 3 1/2 ounce (100 gram) serving contains 118 calories, 18% protein and less than 1% unsaturated fat. The same amount of beef has 207 calories and 32.2% protein and is high in saturated fats. As recent studies have shown, our need for protein is much lower than previously believed and any opportunity to remove saturated fats from our diet would be an excellent improvement.Another dietary benefit of seitan is its low sodium content, although cooking often adds considerably to this. Most of the commercially prepared seitan contains a considerable amount of sodium (up to 100 mg. per ounce). If you choose to deep-fry the gluten, the fat content will jump from virtually zero to the number of grams in whatever oil is absorbed (at 4.5 grams per teaspoon). Moreover, like grain foods in general, this protein is incomplete and needs to be complemented with other protein sources such as dairy or legumes.Many vegetarians\\' first experience with eating gluten is at Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants, where it\\'s called \"mock duck\", \"mock chicken\", etc. When it\\'s sold in little tubs at the natural/health food store, it\\'s called Seitan again, probably because marketing studies showed that the word \"gluten\" lacks consumer appeal. It stands in for meat in many recipes and works so well that some vegetarians prefer to avoid it because the texture is too \"meaty.\" However, for many vegetarians and others who are trying to make the transition to a meatless lifestyle, Wheat Meat\" is growing in popularity.Seitan usually starts out as whole grain wheat or high gluten flour mixed with water to obtain a bread dough consistency. The dough is kneaded vigorously for about 10 minutes, and then is left to rest so the gluten can develop. Next, it is rinsed many times under running water, which removes most of the starch and much of the bran. What is left is a firm, stringy mass of high protein gluten that is then cooked in soy sauce and water with other spices added for flavoring, often including the sea vegetable kombu. When raw gluten (wheat dough with the starch washed away) has been cooked in a broth of shoyu, ginger, and kombu, it\\'s called \"seitan\".It is now ready to be used in casseroles, stir-fry, sandwiches, and enchiladas or just about anywhere that you might previously have used meat. It can be oven-braised, baked, cooked in a pressure cooker, or deep-fried. Each version yields a different texture. Oven braising produces a texture similar to the chewy texture derived from simmering. Baking produces a light texture that works well when grinding or grating seitan. Pressure-cooking will produce a softer texture. Fried gluten turns soft and slippery when cooked with a sauce and absorbs flavor well. - Written by Alyx Sandborg, Copyright 2002 by PageWise, IncWestwood has  lost weight by eating high protein meat substitutes  and has enjoyed such a lift from his better diet and fitness that he is being sponsored by a well-known meat substitute company ( urlLink Quorn ) for two years.

It\\'s been a while since our last get-together. For those who are new, this is a monthly (usually) hour devoted to meat-free cooking, eating and shopping, held on the last Thursday on the month. Since we last discussed, I came across a fun piece on Yahoo! about a new term coined for people who consider themselves part-time vegetarians: \"flexatarian.\" I think that would aptly describe my eating habits. Interesting piece because it brings to light that more and more people are eating less and less meat and choosing diversity among their food sources rather than the same ole same ole. So, tell what\\'s happening in your worlds...by the way, my upcoming video series will feature some veggie items -- will keep you posted. Onward..._______________________I\\'m a goin veggie huntin....: Kim!; Two questions: First, are you going to do another farmers market tour anytime soon? Second, what great things should I look for at the farmers market this saturday morning? Kim O\\'Donnel: The nice people at Arlington Courthouse have been very patient with me as I\\'ve not gotten my act together on setting a date. It\\'ll be sometime in May or June, probably June. Funny you ask about what\\'s at market: my bit on WTOP this morning was all about my finds last weekend. Think green, kids. It\\'s all about the greens -- green garlic, garlic chives, cilantro, parsley, chervil, asparagus, lamb\\'s quarters (tastes like spinach, super easy to cook), baby kale, frisee, baby lettuce...such beauty and so tasty!_______________________Frederick, Md.: I\\'m a strict vegetarian and have always loved the creative aspects of cooking. However, my diet restrictions have prevented me from pursuing any formal culinary training. Can you recommend any culinary programs that are vegetarian-friendly? (My goal is not necessarily to become a full-time chef, but a vegetarian food writer/cookbook author.)Kim O\\'Donnel: There is a vegetarian cooking school in New York City that has a good reputation. Name escapes me at the moment; it might be Natural Cookery something something...there are also shorter-term culinary vacations that are veg-friendly. Check out shawguides.com_______________________St. Paul, Minn.: My two-year-old is allergic to milk but can eat yogurt; he also drinks a little soy milk. I don\\'t think he gets enough calcium. Any suggestions? And can you tell me how to make a smoothie? After I make one, how long can I leave it in the refrigerator?Kim O\\'Donnel: Lentils are loaded with calcium. Spinach and broccoli also good sources...there\\'s soy yogurt out there...don\\'t know if allergy extends to goat\\'s milk, but lots of new brands offering goat\\'s milk yogurt...smoothies: I prefer with yogurt, and to it, I add 1 banana, plus any other fruits on hand, including a kiwi, a handful of berries, some pineapple, a half mango...blend. I don\\'t add ice or juice because I like mine thicker, but you certainly can adjust to your tastes. Doesn\\'t last long at all in fridge; best to drink within one hour._______________________Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim. Just got back from New Orleans and while I made an exception to my vegetarian leanings to try a bite of jambalaya, I\\'d love to make my own. Any suggestions? I\\'m thinking smoked tofu, maybe?Kim O\\'Donnel: I think smoked tofu is an interesting idea, and you\\'ve got meatless sausage links as well as the Gimme Lean brand of tube-like sausage that fries up well...hope you\\'re adding okra!_______________________Prince Frederick, Md.: Can anyone recommend a good vegetarian cookbook that doesn\\'t look like it was put together by a bunch of Sherpas in Tibet. Most of what I\\'ve seen were printed on course-textured paper, brown ink, rather depressing to say the least. I want to know which grains and beans and dairy can be combined to make favorful, healthy meals without a lot of fat. I still use dairy and eggs -- you don\\'t need to kill a cow or chicken for those things.I can go for weeks without eating meat; it\\'s not a major portion of my diet. But what really turned me off about meat was reading \"Fast Food Nation.\" It revealed how filthy and dangerous our meat packing plants are, what evils lurk in your meat which can make you very sick, and what underhanded management of the food industry is doing to us. I recommend everyone read it, as well as \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair.Kim O\\'Donnel: Prince,  Vegetarian cookbooks have come a LONG way from the days of co-ops and communes...There are so many titles out there you may have trouble deciding. Immediately what comes to mind are titles by Deborah Madison, Jeanne Lemlin and then there\\'s Crescent Dragonwagon\\'s \"Passionate Vegetarian\", loads of titles by Robin Robertson...and all of them are very contemporary._______________________Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim,My husband is trying to find out how to make this pasta sauce that is green and creamy, with gorgonzola and walnuts. Any ideas as to what it is?  Thanks a bunch!Kim O\\'Donnel: The green is probably coming from either arugula or spinach. This is a fun one to make, pretty easy, too. You can mix some gorgonzola with a touch of cream, stir over heat, gently tho...you could puree the greens, drain out water, REALLY well...mix in with the cheese, add nuts, chopped, and then mix into your pasta..._______________________Virginia: Does you have any suggestions for good-quality fake chicken or beef? I am looking for big pieces, not something that is \"ground.\" I have tried a couple of things without much luck. Thanks!Kim O\\'Donnel: Many looking for similar products like the taste of Quorn, which is made from a mycoprotein (fungus similar to mushrooms)...they\\'ve got Quorn roasts, and patties and nuggets and all kinds of things...anyone else with fake meat ideas?_______________________Anonymous: I have known people who can\\'t drink cow\\'s milk but are just fine with goat milk. They sell it at Whole Foods.Kim O\\'Donnel: Thanks for chiming in...that\\'s what I was thinking..._______________________Silver Spring, Md.: For meatless jambalaya, I\\'d use tempeh, I like it better than tofu in a tomatoey dish. Some seitan might be good for texture also.Kim O\\'Donnel: Ah, bueno. Thanks, Silver!_______________________Reston, Va.: I\\'m sure you have answered this a billion times, but I hope you will humor me anyway... are there any year-round farmer\\'s markets in the area (pref. northern va)?Kim O\\'Donnel: Yes, yes, yes!  Arlington Courthouse, on Saturday mornings.  Dupont Circle and Takoma Park, Sunday mornings. _______________________Veggie burger: I\\'ve been trolling through the archives, but can\\'t find it. Can somebody offer up a good home-made veggie burger recipe? Not lentils, please (ewww...)Kim O\\'Donnel: A few months back, there was a slew of ideas over a two-week period. Since then, I made chickpea patties, tinkered with some recipes and came up with my own variation. I did chickpeas and mashed potatoes, with herbs, garlic, onion...but I gotta get you the details. I don\\'t have them here at my desk, but am happy to provide after I look through my papers at home..._______________________Arlington, Va.: We like to eat Morning Star Farms \"Chik Nuggets\" - they also come in patties. My son particularly likes to have this when friends who \"hate\" veggies are over, \\'cause they usually love them and can\\'t believe they ate something NOT chicken.Kim O\\'Donnel: Thanks for weighing in on this \\'meaty\\' matter, Arlington._______________________East Falls Church, Va.: Hi, Kim!You mentioned last chat (Tues) that you mash ginger in morter and pestle. I presume you peel it first, but I, too, hate grating ginger and would like to try this option. (for example, do you have to mash more than needed to get enough?).Thanks!Kim O\\'Donnel: Hey EFC,  Yeah, I cut off what I need, then peel it with a teaspoon, cut into a few smaller pieces and then pound with the m Works really well, and no, you do get what you need._______________________Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C.: For your reader who inquired about the vegetarian  cooking school . . . yes, it\\'s called the Natural  Gourmet Cookery School  (www.naturalgourmetschool.com) in New York City.  They also do dinners open to the public on most  Friday evenings. Sounds like a great opportunity to  sample great food from the students.Kim O\\'Donnel: Hey, thanks for following up!_______________________New York, N.Y.: Kim,I need fruit help. I feel stuck between seasons--apples and pears on the way out, citrus is blah, but it\\'s too early for summer fruits, right? What should I look for that\\'s going to be tasty, that is, in season or almost in season? I\\'m 8 months pregnant and trying very hard to be good, when I all really want is to stop at Kripsy Kreme!;Thanks!;Kim O\\'Donnel: It IS a tough time for fruit. I was just thinking the same thing while in the supermarket this week. Soon come: local strawberries, plus figs. Mangoes are coming in from various parts of the world where they are in season, fyi..._______________________Re: Low Fat Veggie Cookbook: Moosewood has a low-fat vegetarian cookbook, and it includes MANY more things than what sherpas would eat. It has its fair share of twigs and berries, but also a lot of grains, beans, tofu, pasta, and cheese variations.Kim O\\'Donnel: Thanks for reminding me...my Moosewood, with the international focus, is very dog-eared from years of use._______________________For Reston looking for farmers market in NoVa:: The Falls Church farmers mkt at city hall starts this week, on saturday morningsKim O\\'Donnel: Great news, and thanks for helping out a fellow reader._______________________Alexandria, Va.: Hi Kim!When you mention farmers\\' markets, you often neglect to mention the Alexandria Farmers\\' Market, which goes year-round, and is the oldest in the area. It\\'s open from 5:30am (ugh!)to 10:30am every Saturday.Kim O\\'Donnel: Very glad that you\\'ve reminded me, Alexandria._______________________Virginia: I am so excited, I just have to share. For years, I have been trying to make mango lassis like the ones in Indian restaurants, but the ones I made were never as good. I finally found the secret: rosewater. You only need a couple of drops, but it makes all the difference. Also, the frozen mango chunks from Trader Joe\\'s make lassi-making very easy, and I find the quality to be very good. I have been drinking them every day this week!Kim O\\'Donnel: Funny you mention that - was just talking with the woman who\\'s been consulting me on some Indian recipes for video series, and she was saying that very thing...but if you add too much, your lassi can taste like lipstick...thanks for sharing._______________________Silver Spring, Md.: Hi Kim -  I have been eating a wonderful whole grain mixture for breakfast - oat groats, millet, brown rice, seeds, etc... I\\'ve been mixing with apple and it\\'s very yummy.I\\'m thinking it would also make a great salad, with jicama, zucchini, red peppers and more but don\\'t know how to dress it. Do you have any ideas?Love your chats - you rock!Kim O\\'Donnel: Squeeze of lemon or orange or grapefruit and some olive oil, Silver. Some fresh chopped parsley or cilantro, salt, pepper, garlic, scallions. Sounds nice._______________________Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim, I want to make a tofu and veggie curry...does tofu go with curry seasonings? Also, i\\'m not great with really spicy stuff, so can you give me a good mild (yet flavorful!) curry recipe to use with this? Would I cook the tofu at all before adding it in? I\\'m not sure where to start...Thanks!!Kim O\\'Donnel: Do you want to do coconut milk curry? Talk to me._______________________Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim,  White bean bruschetta - I tried to make it  last night but forgot the ingredients -  I  bought the wrong kind of beans. Here\\'s  what I came up with so far - what am I  missing (or how can I vary it)?tomatoes, onions, lime juice, fresh basilKim O\\'Donnel: The beauty of bruschetta is that you can mess up and no one will ever know...in Italy, bruschetta are among the many \"salatini\" that are put out on bar counters as snacks,and often they consist of ingredients in the kitchen at that moment. You can vary this any way you want...one fun thing is to toast bread slices and then rub a whole clove of garlic on each slice...don\\'t forget salt. Lemon zest is great. Rosemary is beautiful with white beans...one thing that helps is to keep you mixture fairly dry..._______________________Fairfax, Va: Kim,My wonderful, beautiful, patient wife is a vegetarian, and I\\'m a happy meat eater. I\\'d like to make her a special dinner some night, but I\\'d like to do it on the grill. What can I cook for her that will be flavorful and unique? (And how do I do it)?Thanks!;Kim O\\'Donnel: You can make her skewers of pineapple, red onion (or pearl onions), bell peppers and squares of tofu. Brush the whole thing with soy sauce, sesame oil, a little honey and sprinkle some cayenne. Serve over rice. You, sir, can have that, after you grilled for your lovely wife, a steak or some fish kebabs..._______________________Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim,  Speaking of farmer\\'s markets, do you know what is going on with the one that started last year, on Thursdays in Penn Quarter (I think it was on 7th and E maybe?) Is it coming back? Do you know when? It was so nice to be able to do some quick shopping on my way home from the office since the area is bereft of any real supermarkets...  Thanks!Kim O\\'Donnel: Yes, it is. Starting next Thursday, May 6, from 3 to 7._______________________Bethesda, Md.: Hello-  Do you know where one could go to pick strawberries and the like around here? Preferably in MD. THanksKim O\\'Donnel: Weekend section usually does an annual list which I\\'m betting will come out next month. Anyone with tried and true strawberry picking spots?_______________________Rockville, Md.: My favorite Italian restaurant serves veggie ravioli with a killer pistachio cream sauce. In making this at home would you recommend the \"plain old salted\" bagged variety or using plain nuts instead...Kim O\\'Donnel: Plain, unsalted. You got it..._______________________Vegetarian Pigs in a Blanket: Does anyone have any ideas for how to make vegetarian pigs in a blanket? I am open to both synthetic meat and more natural options. Thanks!;Kim O\\'Donnel: I\\'m throwing this out to you guys for thoughts, etc..._______________________Washington, D.C.: Hey Kim, A quick question for you- whare are some good (tasty and healthy) snack foods you could reccomend? I\\'m trying to cut back on sugar, so I\\'d rather have some sort of veggie and dip as a snack after work instead of a cookie. ThanksKim O\\'Donnel: Making your own hummus or white bean spread is very easy, takes about 15 minutes. Can be used for dipping or as a sandwich filler...high protein, no sugar, good fats from olive oil..._______________________soy bechamel?: Any reason not to use soy milk in a bechamel sauce? There\\'s a recipe for a killer mushroom lasanga made with a bechamel sauce in the March Cooking Light that I\\'d like to modify. ThanksKim O\\'Donnel: Chemical composition of soy milk is different, but doesn\\'t mean it can\\'t work. I don\\'t know for sure. My copy of \"Dairy-Free Cooking\" offers some \"cream sauce\" ideas...so why not??_______________________Vege in Fairfax, Va.: To the question about Paneer from the What\\'s cooking chat. One can drain it in Cheese cloth and tea sieve to hold the contents in. Keep in a cold place overnite. Remember to close the top of the sieve so that other odors from other products dont mix in.  Actually Mango lassi is not very common in India. Lassi is usually salty. I just buy low fat butter milk and make a spice mixture of roasted cumin, curry leaves, rock salt and white pepper(all ground together) and beat the lassi until frothy. Yummy  Try cardamon in your Mango lassi for the extra zing!Kim O\\'Donnel: Thanks, Fairfax...great tidbits...I\\'m only just learning about buttermilk for lassis..._______________________St. Louis, Mo.: Another cookbook suggestion: I started out veggie with the \"Horn of the Moon\" cookbook by Ginny Callan. Many yummy recipes, all vegetarian. A follow-up book, \"Beyond the Moon,\" includes more recipes with an international/fusion twist (Carribean variations, tempeh burritos, etc.) Worth a look.Kim O\\'Donnel: Not familiar with this one, St. Lou. Thanks for the tidbit..._______________________Suitland, Md.: Does anyone know of a good Soy Cheese brand? Something that actually tastes like cheese? I am looking for a block that I can grate.Thanks!!Kim O\\'Donnel: Who knows of soy cheese that can be grated???_______________________Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim!; I have some fresh green beans and want to do something spicy with them, but without a trip to the store. I have oil, soy sauce, dried red crushed pepper, and fresh garlic. I was thinking of stirring them up in a pan, but would it be better to blanch them first? Thanks!;Kim O\\'Donnel: Blanching them does help bring them along, Washington, even if you only do it for a minute or so...not a bad idea...._______________________Bethesda, Md.: Hello Kim-  I have an eggplant question for you. I generally hate eggplant (hate the texture) but there is one way that I really, really love it. I know it is simple but can\\'t figure it out. I usually have it as antipasto in Italian restaurants or when I was in Italy. It is basically sliced eggplant and balsamic vinigar. I don\\'t know if it is cooked and then cooled to room temp or simply marinated. Can you help me? ThanksKim O\\'Donnel: Eggplant is one of those things that needs to be cooked, Bethesda. Was it in cubes, slices, all mushed up? Do tell..._______________________Boston, Mass.: Hi Kim,What can I do with Broccoli besides steam it?  Thanks!Kim O\\'Donnel: I like roasting it, at 500 degrees. But first, roll florets in a mix of chopped ginger, olvie oil, garlic, paprika, salt, black pepper, stuff like that. It\\'s a great treat!_______________________Indian Head, Md.: Hi Kim! My new favorite meal: vegetarian tacos made with tempeh and browned onions. I am using a boxed mix, but would like suggestions on making the taco seasoning from scratch.They are delicious with veggie cheese, tomatoes and julienned spinach on top!JKim O\\'Donnel: Let\\'s see...I\\'d do cayenne, black pepper, oregano, cumin, garlic powder, cloves (a dash only!), maybe even some coriander..._______________________Washington, D.C.: My special someone has a birthday coming up and I wanted to cook something specatular and vegetarian for them. Do you have any cookbooks or sources or recipes in mind that I could try and use?Kim O\\'Donnel: Spectacular and vegetarian...I\\'m thinking of a curry. I\\'ve got an interesting idea for a Thai-style tofu curry with pineapples and potatoes, but I think cauliflower, green beans would also go beatifully...let me know if this is of interest..._______________________Oxford, Miss: I\\'m a vegetarian and one of my favorite meals is rice and beans, but I\\'m getting bored with my recipe. Do you have any suggestions for how to liven up this old classic?Kim O\\'Donnel: Do you make a sofrito for your r b? You know, a mixture of chopped onions, green peppers, garlic and some herbs...like a little thyme or oregano...I\\'d also add a chopped fresh chile..._______________________Reston, Va.: Good morning Kim. Still struggling with the white sweet potatos. Any ideas?Thanks!Kim O\\'Donnel: Not very often that we see white sweet potatoes...I\\'d roast them, mix with lime, cilantro and sesame oil after cooking...or do some garlic and chiles, plus a little oil...fresh parsley is also nice, a little lemon zest..._______________________Herndon, Va.: Oh joy - grilling time is upon us... but my  marinate recall has lapsed  please advise with some great basics for  marinating - I\\'m specifically thinking of the  little mushrooms and zucchini I bought  yesterday for BBQ skewers, but a good  marinate could work on most foods...also, any hints on grilling veg on  skewers?  thanks in advanceKim O\\'Donnel: Salt really well. Use a brush. Olive oil, although simple, is a good standby...fresh sprigs of herbs are great too...indirect heat...pieces should all be the same size..._______________________Reston, VA: Hooray for the mention of the Alexandria farmers\\'  market. My great-grandfather sold there every  Saturday morning and my great-aunt and my dad  tell fabulous stories about getting up -really- early  to go to market. There are also lots of stories about  my dad stealing strawberries out of the baskets that  were packed on Friday...Kim O\\'Donnel: Nice story, Reston. Thanks for the memories..._______________________Re: strawberry picking: Butler\\'s Orchard, in Germantown (MD). You can call their phone line to find out what\\'s available when.Kim O\\'Donnel: Excellent!_______________________Laurel, MD: Chiming in:Rice and beans: I\\'ve been planning a reverse black beans  and white rice using white beans and some of the black  rice, seasoned with a South-east Asian theme.Kim O\\'Donnel: Ooh...I like that..._______________________Dallas, Texas - Arugala: Hi Kim.  Wanted to share a great sauce recipe. I sauteed fresh asparagus spears in some water (could use wine) and lemon juice, with salt and pepper. Then added a can of crushed tomatoes, and a little bit of sugar, garlic, and onions. Let it all cook together till the sauce thickens. I served it with brown rice, but it could be easily served with pasta. At the end, add fresh arugala - it adds incredible zip to the recipe. Very healthy and delicious. And with all the flavors, you won\\'t miss the meat.~Chef in trainingKim O\\'Donnel: Very nice indeed, Dallas. Keep sending reports of your experiments!_______________________Washington, DC: This may sound a little strange, but what exactly are white beans? I.E. does the can say \"White Beans\" are is it like white fish and any number of varities could apply? Thanks for the insight.Kim O\\'Donnel: White beans actually refer to only a few kinds: cannellini (which are really white kidney beans) and Great Northern beans. They are interchangeable._______________________Adams Morgan: How does one make a white bean spread?Kim O\\'Donnel: A can of drained white beans. Whiz in a food processor. Olive oil, garlic, chopped fresh rosemary, cayenne, salt. Taste. Lemon zest is nice, too. Taste. Add more seasoning if needed. Taste for smoothness, too. You\\'re good to go._______________________Arlington, VA: Hi,I hope you can help me. I have a 7 year old who used to eat all kinds of vegitables. Ever since she started school, she stopped eating vegitables. The only vegitable she\\'ll eat are corn on the cob or if I grind up veggies inside dumplings. I tried serving veggies with gravy/salt/cheese and she acts like she\\'s in Fear Factor eating worms. I think it\\'s a texture thing. Do you have any suggestions?Kim O\\'Donnel: Take her to the farm market this weekend. Introduce her to a farmer. Let her pick out something that the two of you can make together. Obviously she likes veggies if she was eating them before; making the preparation fun could open her eyes. Let me know how it goes..._______________________Kim O\\'Donnel: Out of time, folks. Thanks for all the good stuff. Take good care, eat well, and get out there to your neighborhood farm market! The air is now fresh, the new crops are for the taking! Promise to be back for end of May, and in meatime, join me for the regular Tuesday free for all..Best to you._______________________ Â© 2004 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive  By JESSICA RAE PATTON, May 7 2004  I recently spent the weekend in Chicago, the city of encased meat. Just about any poor critter that can be ground and stuffed in a swag of intestine, then boiled or grilled and served in a bun, can be bought for a couple bucks every few blocks at one of the ubiquitous hot dog stands there.  At Hot Doug\\'s, for example, aside from the traditional pork and beef wieners there were chicken, pheasant, wild boar and lamb tube steaks.  But there were also rumors of a veggie dog, which is how my animal-munching friend Emily lured me to this popular bratwurst bistro. Because the fact is, although I\\'m a vegan, I\\'m a fool for fake meat. Or anything, really, that can serve as a vehicle for condiments and be eaten alongside French fries, the more lowbrow the atmosphere the better--diners, burger shacks, carnival snack stands. These food venues usually fall short in the fried-faux-meat category, as you might imagine. But I guess because Chicago\\'s a city teeming with working-class hipsters--two-fisted liberals, as Studs Terkel refers to them--folks whose proletariat taste buds sometimes clash with their compassionate eating ethics, the local sausage slingers make concessions with their concessions. I, for one, thank Doug and his colleagues for this. That was one damn good dog. Char-grilled, with onions, a pickle spear, some neon relish, tomato slices and yellow mustard, all overflowing a squishy roll.  I returned home with an unabatable hankering for a faux dog with all the fixings, donned the first shorts of the season and set out with the crazy notion that I might be able to score a veggie dog at one of our local hot dog haunts. I dragged my boyfriend, Art, along to taste-test the real ones.  I f you want a guaranteed hostile reaction, head for the greasiest of greasy spoons and suggest they add a veggie dog to the menu. At the original Swanky Frank\\'s, a worn-down wiener shack overlooking a scenic I-95 on-ramp, the owner, Bob, snorted, \"That would be sacrilegious.\"  \"But I was in Chicago, and--\"  \"This isn\\'t Chicago, is it?\" He said and walked away. Was he really pissed off, or just a grouchy guy in general? Maybe I was naÃ¯ve to the subversive nature of soy protein. And here I just wanted one more place to spend my money on some good, cheap grub.  I sat on a rickety stool and ordered French fries and blathered on about writing a food review. The fry cook, who looked like Billy Bob Thornton playing a surly fry cook, shook his head in disgust and muttered something about how you can\\'t write a food review if all you eat is French fries. These guys were in their 30s, early 40s tops, but they had the grumpy old geezer thing down. Their disdain was as thick as the mystery oil they were deep-frying--yup, deep-frying--the dogs in.  In all fairness, our server at the swankier of the Swankies, in Westport, was super-friendly. (Let\\'s consider the first location Skanky Frank\\'s, as to not confuse the two.) She smiled and everything. The place also looked like it had been intimate with both a paintbrush and a sponge in recent memory. Art highly approved of the deep-fried technique. \"It makes the texture crackly, not snappy.\"  \"Snappy?\"  \"Yeah, some hot dogs are snappy. The skin won\\'t give right away when you bite it, then it snaps.\"  He also liked that the raw onions were self-serve. For the sake of quality assurance he ordered the same dog toppings at every stop: bacon, ketchup, onions. \"The bacon\\'s under the dog, where it should be,\" he noted.  The French fries were great: thin-cut, some skin left on for that dirty taste, super-crisp but not crisped through. We liked that our order was wrapped up in an old-timey cardboard box.  Dog: $2.90, Fries: $2.25â\\x80¢ â\\x80¢ â\\x80¢ Rawley\\'s Drive-In 1886 Post Rd., Fairfield, 259-9023  Rawleys\\' dÃ©cor makes Skanky Frank\\'s look positively posh. The wood paneling interior has decades of initials, names and declarations of love scratched into its surface, like a summer camp cabin. Two high-school-age boys flew around the kitchen putting orders together.  \"So. Would you ever consider carrying a veggie dog, you think?\"  \"NO WAY!\" The one working the grill yelled. \"People freak out if we change anything here. We had to repair those walls,\" he gestured to two white walls behind him, \"to meet health codes, and people flipped out. A veggie dog? They\\'d KILL us!\"  They got every single thing about our order wrong--handed us someone else\\'s food, gave Art the wrong drink, rang the order up incorrectly, made it \"for here\" instead of \"to go.\" The more flustered they got, the more they messed up. I didn\\'t mind a bit. It somehow went with the summer camp vibe, and I thought it was probably a fluke. They were extremely apologetic. \"It was SO busy a minute ago, we were SLAMMED,\" the one at the cash register explained.  The word \"Poop\" was engraved in huge letters right below the counter.  The cook pulled Art\\'s dog from the fry basket, split it and threw it on the grill. \"It\\'s deep-fried and grilled?\" I asked, because I couldn\\'t believe it. It was like a heart attack on a bun.  After a couple investigative bites, Art reported that he actually preferred Swanky Frank\\'s single dose of grease, though the Rawley\\'s dog also passed the crackly texture test, the bun was fresh and well-toasted and there was a generous amount of bacon draped over the dog.  I was still trying to interpret \"snappy.\" \"Is it that feeling of breaking the seal with your teeth?\" I asked.  \"Exactly,\" he said.  \"I like that,\" I said.  \"That\\'s the thing. It\\'s so hard to judge hot dogs, because they\\'re such a historical food in a person\\'s life.\" He gestured philosophically with his dog. \"People are fanatical about these. This is the perfect hot dog if it\\'s what you grew up with.\"  No one could get nostalgic about the fries, however, which were of the frozen, crinkle-cut variety, mealy and barely browned.  Dog: $2.40, Fries: $1.90â\\x80¢ â\\x80¢ â\\x80¢ Super Duper Weenie 306 Black Rock Turnpike,Fairfield, 334-DOGS  I admit I was biased in favor of Super Duper Weenie to begin with for its name. And if I had to eat off any of the linoleum-checked floors, this would be the one. By now I was resigned that there were no take-out veggie dogs in my near future... when I spotted its cousin on the menu.  \"How long have you carried veggie burgers for?\" I asked the cashier, who turned out to be one of the owners, Lorin.  \"Since we opened,\" he said.  \"But you don\\'t have a veggie dog?\"  \"Veggie dog? I can\\'t say we\\'ve ever considered it.\" He appeared to actually be contemplating the concept.  \"Would you consider it?\"  \"I don\\'t think they\\'d sell.\"  \"Do the veggie burgers sell?\"  \"Yeah.\"  \"So why wouldn\\'t a veggie dog?\"  \"We\\'re a greasy hot dog place.\"  \"You could just try it out.\"  \"We have tuna...\"  \"Please?\"  \"I\\'ll think about it. We\\'ve honestly never thought of it before.\"  Art surveyed his super duper dog. Plentiful onions, two fat strips of bacon. But I could tell his assessment by the face he made when biting down. Snappy. He liked the flavor of the meat, if not the texture, but Swanky Frank\\'s was his personal overall favorite dog of the day, no question.  We agreed the fries were stellar--the best of the bunch by far. Lots of skin, whittled-thin shapes, perfectly crisp with downy insides. Lorin gave the batch a generous shake of pepper as well as salt. Pepper on French fries! Kind of nouveau cuisine for a former hot dog truck, don\\'t you think? I just know an animal-free frank is next...  Dog: $2.70 Fries: $2.25  Copyright Â© 2004, Fairfield County WeeklyHere is a little introduction to a few of them  Soya : Soya is a good source of protein and low fat. Can be used to produce milk, dairy replacements products, as well as to replace the texture and bulk of meat, usually in the form of textured vegetable protein. Is usually the basis for many meat substitutes.  Tofu  : Manufactured by a process similar to cheese making, but from soya milk. Very good source of protein, calcium and low fat.  Able to take on flavours well â\\x80\\x94 great for marinating. Can be used for stirâ\\x80\\x93fries, kebabs, salads and just about anything savoury. Tofu also is available in a silken form which is used for desserts, sauces or flans.  Quorn : Not made from soya but is a mycoprotein. Made from the fermentation of a fungus, mixed with egg white. Usually found as chunks, mince, fillets, burgers or sausages. Outside North Ridge Hospital, the one that I know all the shortcuts to, I sit waiting for Triple A after hand holding in room 426 this time.  My grandmother is in again for rehydration. This time it\\'s been 8 days. Today was by far the hardest. I decided to reach across and hold her hand bruised, swollen, arthritis with gout, not really a hand anymore.  Years of sewing trusses, hunched over, and for low pay.  I suspect she won\\'t be around much longer. I think she has decided to let go. After all, there is nothing left here for her but more pain and the missing husband of 53 years, now dead 13 months.  The past 6 have been reasonable considering her coherence is so limited but today she was there. I saw in her eyes the same Grandmother who played games with me all summer long, put on plays, treated me like sugar on top of strawberries and now, me, child of 30 at her bedside; shriveled old woman the years were not kind to, wanting death knowing too full well now in my reaching out was saying to her from all of us for the first time the last time, you are forgiven.  CarnivalOh, but to feel this good, this flushed face, your voice,  breathe, breathe.  I am hyperventalating. I am electrified; blowing up like a balloon  and rising to the top of the tent past tight-rope walkers.

Accidental RhymeIt comes out like this, running water against porcelain, into a glass, or bottle,  captured for espresso, mixed into soup, taken with vitamins, or with a $20 placebo when I am lucky.  It quenches my thirst or leaves me bloated. When I jump up and down, I can hear it always inside me sloshing around.  Six Before BreakfastMemories of wanting more and I left you the gift  of my sigh to ponder, getting the last word in before my power cut off,  denying all but me the right to caffeine.  Eight hours later, the work day spent, my smile shows no sign of setting into the horizon.  I wonder  will I wake to your words in the morning.  5:30 Wake Up CallThe dream ended abruptly, your voice on the line  and I couldn\\'t roll over and turn it off, knowing time is too short to make decisions.  You tell me what love is;  unbroken speech, poetry before sun up and you tell me what love is;  again.  I listen, but there is more in my silence.  I listen, my inner abacus clicking and clacking against and over the crackling static that does not come from a clear connection;  and you tell me what I am afraid of;  again.  I have no time for these  parlor games;  cheap satoris leaving others open mouthed and astonished,  but not me.  I dealt those same cards eight and half years ago, my ego fed by those same eyes, that same hunger for confirmation seldom remembered the next day, and so the repetition continues.  You tell me what I want because you are afraid to hear the words from my lips and in an instant crack your mirror  or reflect something you will not remember tomorrow.  Kundalini RizingI am cross legged, spine growing, root to the ground; pushing it all towards the center and breathing deep light from below, from above, meets in the heart chakra up to the blue light shining,  lotus flower opening, growing, tickles like static electricity like the salt pepper atomic tv glow, chanelled, funneled up like a tube, suction, highcracking of stretching, straight then swaying  here, now.  HelloWanting to call you is pushing a hole right through, band-aid ripped from skin leaving a ring around the wound;  and the dancing visions, and the considerations, weighing, measuring,  and the wondering of how you would answer and would I get to read you this.

I tell the woman to my right that 33% of all the water in Jacksonville must go to feed these lawns; a number pulled out of my ass, but possibly true.  Golfers spot the landscape like cat shit in litter.  I am thinking of the house off Stockton where I spent yesterday, crackheads bumming my clove cigarettes.  I am thinking of the neighborhood I wasn\\'t supposed to walk in after dark and the kids I never saw playing outside.  The wind is blowing and inside the meeting space, people vend their wares to investment bankers and 5th hole wives.  I stub out my smoke and steal a pack of matches from the shiny, clean ashtray.  Out of Town SuitWaiting for the others to join me at the meeting, I look over my shoulder, suspicious as I type  poetry, in my corporate suit and coffee at hand.  Later, the attendees arrive; two sets of eyes looking for leadership and direction, and all I want to do is get this down on paper,  barely able to contain my need to explain.  There are handouts and brochures scattered about, and nobody knows what\\'s going on at this account.  I am watching them both for inspiration, the way he draws a wobbly arrow in his daytimer, or the laugh-hairflip combo from the woman across my way, beautiful and lost at 23.  I am taking control, and setting expectations.  I am the senior member at the table with no time for distractions.  Moments later, cell phones ring and the meeting is adjourned.  I open back up my laptop and type this.  ReverieI\\'m not remembering my dreams just yet.images of me at the shore taking off my necklace and holding it in the waterThe morning wake up call and workout you see, it\\'s all just so hectic.  My favorite thought at the beginning, \"I\\'m walking amongst them,\" turns, and even I sour.  Still, I\\'m not quite dreaming, not even for three sustained days.  Sometimes I don\\'t mind the drive.  SundayI let Sunday slide down the back of my neck, without, a peep ing Tom at you.

I absorbed you like a sponge, a bystander, the auctioneer, going, going...  but what could I offer you  in return, my body of work a messy string of cables and wires connecting everybody but me;  my body of work, a folder of pictures, from when I still dreamed of silver towers, the turbo elevator, and  eating at the company cafeteria like it was some kind of privlege.You have to believe in something.I was traded like a basketball star. I was sold to the highest bidder. I was pimped out to hunchbacks lapping the keys and told to repeat myself again and again.  I have told nobody the entire story and only you would understand when I say  that at least alcohol  was more honest.  SkortWhen I was younger, it was my \"whore heels,\" as Daniel was fond of saying.  Tight and black with thick wooden heels, the shoes and me, were captured on film,  only 22 years young.  Older now, I rise in my skort,  small and beige, $5.00 off the sale rack at Macy\\'s,  and I am as strong as I was the lost night in Weston,  singing along with the radio on my way to get smokes.

In Due TimeFantasies of writing again push me to discuss the option.

It comes because it comes  and if I don\\'t let it out, I have no way of  remembering who I am;  and if I don\\'t let it out, I grow ever inward, silent, shamed.  Far better to committ to three pages a day, and learn about myself by reading.  In due time, more will come.  Personal AdA stab at normalacy, I wandered to the  Personals web site for just a look;  decided to post.

You,  always on the look  out for true love or  the next best thing.  Maybe I\\'m the latter, or ladder, whose rungs you have yet to climb.  Maybe I\\'m the light you left on by mistake.  It\\'s enough for me now to be humble.  It keeps me in control.  Nicotine is a Bitch GoddessHalf-crazed I plunder my home in search of a lighter;  settle on the stove.  I am smoking inside again. It\\'s all those damn hotel stays, smoking room, king sized bed, and me alone, wretched, pathetic, covers pulled awry and feet hanging out,  thinking about bed fires.  Nicotine is a bitch goddess.  Ok, so it\\'s true. I did start smoking to look cool; 15 and insecure, knowing I was different; wanting it to show more.  I laid down at her alter and bought my first pack of Dorals.  16 years later, I singe eyelashes over Basic menthol lights.  What is it about menthols anyway? Nobody ever wants to bum.  I would have been cooler getting Marlboro reds and packing them down;  tap, tap, tap.  Half-Assed ArtistWhen I hand over the drawing or poem, it\\'s the same look;  betrayal,  expectation of genius and I give them only this.  My Real JobIt is frustrating, this waiting, this wondering about what exactly it is that I am supposed to be doing here  on this earth, in this house, with this life.  Sometimes, I cramp with shoulds;  the inside voices, huddled together, scheming over plans written in the past.  Sometimes, I burn with maybes;  lofty ideas about what a better person I might become.  I am seldom content with  the moment , unless in silence,  in meditation,  in contemplation and recognition that it is all I have.  When the Moment StrikesSuddenly you are lifted from the fog,  and all around and inside  is now.  Almost without warning, the picture sharpens;  and even name badges carry hidden meaning.  The words that come out are flushed with heart beat;  some truth to utter,  practicing for the real job that has yet to come;  but sits so close now on the edge of the river,  dangling its toes in the water.  Every Poem Has Two HalvesEvery poem  has  two halves.  The first half is pulled.  The second is pushed.  It is giving  and taking, needing  and having.  Letters form in head, letters form on  page.

Correcting Each OtherOn the second call it seemed clear enough, that a presence hung over us;heavy memoryand we began to correct each other.  You spoke of stacks of poetry, 40,000 pages strong.  a nd I know just how strong\"Prolific,\" I said. \"Committed,\" you countered.Understood, my friend.Later on, you were recalling one incident or another. You called me \"forgiving.\"  \"Accepting, I reminded.Understood again, my friend.It took the charts to bring out the rest.Some GoddessYou said that, \"I inspire you.\"  And I gushed, girly, giggly, as expected by law;  a law that states a woman could hope for nothing better  but to be muse for some man.  Listen, hon. Epiphanies are not for barter. I offer you nothing in trade.  You chose your muse long ago  (and it comes in a can.)Don\\'t misunderstand me. I judge no one.  You chose your muse before I was even born;  and  perhaps a lesson for me  is to get off my ass and choose my own;  having learned in the end that love and working for the man ain\\'t gonna cut it.  I have nothing to say, pissed again that the last milepost was just another damn cliche.  Asking For StoriesWords pool along the base and cling to the wick for a moment before letting go.  I watch them slide.  My thoughts are no longer my own. I am reaching for a pen. I am looking for some paper.  I am trying to catch the drips that have eluded me for six years;  the background conversations, the inner dialogue that kept me company on the turnpike but would not stain the page.  I am staring into the flame now, noticing the colors and shadows on the wall,  finger families looking up with wide eyes and asking for stories again.In the Moments of RediscoveryIn the moments of rediscovery, there is a hesitation;  sweeter than chocolate; richer, deeper, brown;  where possibilities hold themselves in shimmering waves of infinite choice.

Who would have told her to leave the laying of golden eggs to the goose?roasted and splayed on the table, stuffing dribbling out of body cavities  when the eggs stopped comingWhat magic mirror had the ovaries to tell her that everything she knew was a fairy tale?  And that that the rescue parthappily ever afterwas something  she could have done herself in the end?  Survival InstinctMirrors crack, smashed to pieces, shards falling easily,  reflecting a face still used to control, eyes snapping up love  like a paper fan.  Someone is sad. Someone is unsure.  The fit is just not there yet.  There are many layers to digest  and unfold into words.  There are worlds waiting exploration, colors and lights and music, gumball bliss, graffiti sunsets, and the answer  we\\'ve all been waiting for, waving  from the next balcony over.  Who Art In HeavenHungry to believe that I was the one that asked the moon for forgiveness,  the story is repeated, perhaps for the third time.  I can\\'t be sure,  could be more.  And this I say  to tell you a reason for this  touch deprived angst.  Exuses and reminders, a no win situation or  escape.  Let the dead bury their dead. Release the burdens of your soul. They do not belong to you. They do not control you  Answer it truthfully, here and now.  There is no heavenly father and the one that shows up is years too late,  having forgotten the purpose of his labors, and no rest on the seventh day.  LessonsThe unknown is never known; just remembered.  ThunderAnd so it goes on for those blessed enough with a healthy past no clean break,clean continuationSqueeky morality. Cheeky morality for popes in hats and nuns in wigs,  The scent riding in on the air is warm, real, arms so big they could fold up the sun; clouds, even airplanes held for a moment in the seconds passing by too fast on a rainy afternoon surprise.  Fort LauderdaleNot ready to go back just yet; the stillness,  outside cool air; a smoke on the patio; the cats asleep peaceful vibe.  Dreaming of my Virgo man, who has not yet shown himself to me.  Maybe he is waiting inside a coffeehouse books on table, notepad caputuring the spill;  or traveling the world, taking notes.  The breeze through the window, South Florida autumn, brings the first clear air of seasons through my screen.  Soft cloth to the outside glass, let the sun shine warm this room.  Curtains back, parrots in the sky, another cafe con leche, por favor.  The One That StayedSoft, her face against my face, cheeks touching,  smile, in her sounds, she is stretched, never changed, given without condition,  curling her body against my own as we drift to sleep.  PrecipiceAt the edge on the lion\\'s back,  a glass of water shattered against the tile floor,  clouds open up, reveal the sun,  a paper envelope, greased with  tin, the rust stain,  hair collecting in the corners,  and you are still gone. An Amazing Ten Minutesheavy hung every second longer than day wider than sleep  waiting  unfold inside out  caught  spun into gold  spun into God meaning the cosmos this universe  This Week\\'s Homework: \"To be without attachment and without avoidance.\"  MaestroStronger, your words as though in a flash;  all that you have been, suddenly brilliant, focused, honest, hiding nothing.  Each word, heart beating, pulsing at the lines, spilling, eyes closed, tingling inner,  breathing slower, harder, with each line stanza grouped together; each more powerful than  my last, combining in elements, lining up for the last word;  shot into nothingness, never waiting to stop spinning.  FortissimoSleep beckons, but your words read to me, for me, peal like bells in memory  and I wonder, prone to the condition, curious, demanding,  what will this do to your style;  already changed forever like me.  I do not think or suppose, I am beyond that now, knowing there is no always but now.  Merge and create.  The colors begin to blur, oils mixed in thick haste to cover the pale absence with light.  Chords are stuck, the first time harmony, not even trying, aspiring, and your opus unfolding as I bloom.  FLASH OF REASSURANCEIn an instant, sparklers, the sizzling popping tips, smoking into the July moon.  Fairy tales and unknown possibilities, the penny in the fountain, the divine reaches into nothingness, and a moment\\'s peace.  DETACHMENTMy mother was right. The bone isn\\'t stronger at the place of the break.  I remember this as I listen for the sound of your car turning back.  I have been listening for for 13 years  and you never come.  This time is no different. Your goodbye leaves me  scattered pieces this heart I mended, I tended so carefully these past four months with papers signed.  And tears come like air and sobs are hard like the sprinter\\'s gasp and I find no peace, no deep waters under this shaken surface.  So alone, and you refuse my love again and again.  I know you don\\'t love me. I felt it for six years, the unsurmountable task of communication.  We could find no network that could bring us together, no cables long enough or strong enough to channel the feelings.  And again and again I wait to hear what you can not say.  Maybe you think in your silence you do not hurt my feelings  as much as if I were to hear the truth.  Why is it like this between us?  You are the only man  whose love I have ever  wanted to have.  Time means nothing if it can still hurt just as much now.  THE FIRST COME IS FIRST SERVEDWhy argue when you can persuade, I asked you last night.  The word sashayed  along my tongue,  and I am a snake of influence,  slither and glide, convince and  encourage.  Harmless to most, I carry no poison. I delight in commiseration.  My condolences are no sin.  Even scandal can light the way at times  when dark  is bright.  NO SMOKING SIGNSFive days nicotine free and this hypnosis cure is crueler than patches.  The fire still burns in me, endorphins knowing no rush, and every cell and pore rages at Otis Redding, singing loud and expressive into this waning Wednesday\\'s self-induced insomnia.  The voice repeats in my head and on the audio tape I listen to at night, \"Is it good for me?\" \"Is it worth the price?\"  Breathe deep, count down from 11 to 7.  \"I am relaxed.\" \"I am calm.\" \"I am in control.\"  If I was going to reprogam my mind, for the moment that cravings come, I should have asked for orgasm or side splitting laughter instead.  Note to myself: Think bigger next time.  THE SEEKERShe begins from the top of the skyscraper, a pageless freedom knowing only the path down.  Delicious, fingers type, controlling the speed of descent, a rapture, while God is sought  in guarded temples with the Guru, among bacon eating Buddhists saying Om, with the Universalists teaching of prey and predator, and Christians lighting candles to remember.  She is still searching; books at her side are titled \"Awareness\" or \"Transformation\" and she scolds herself for not remembering her breath.  She has centered herself between the extremes for now and January is cold.  A waning gibbous moon streaks the green outside like frost  and meditation  is found in the details.  THE LAST WORDEven as I reach my door, the drama of you continues; train whistle blow outside my window; and I cried out as we raced to catch the 5:40.  \"Why does this have to be so dramatic?\" and he said,  \"Heather, you wouldn\\'t have it any other way.\"  Train whistle blows a last time, your meaning as you said goodbye, and I choosing myself at last over you.  What healing forms to take the place?  What warm bath of peace, a little gentle place to put the grief.  Back in my box, the hum of the computer, planes overhead dancing, low light, flannel against skin,  breathing again.  I will not be latched in any man\\'s cage. There is no combination to my love or lock to cut off.  I guard and protect my palace with curiosity, having learned the  art of questioning the witness, vicarious observation,  eating the emotions, dipping my bread and licking my fingers clean.  There is such a thing as too close and easy to spot amindst the blackness of eyelid curtains drawn.  Ignite into flame, sparks of wheels braking and every inside awakening.  This is the one I write for you inside my shallow cave of doubt and webs extending time across my space and death at every doorframe.  Damn you, the water that drowns itself, the air that suffocates, the fire leaving ash.  This earth can not bear these burdens nor count the weight of boxes shackled to ankles because you were afraid.  Step up and demand your rightful place. Empty the barrels of regret and shame. Throw the has been into the wind.  You have never been who you are right now.  And if I stamp my feet, and if I scream, then maybe you will leave me alone,  where I want to be, stepping aside.  And you will leave me Sorry China and all your prophesies fulfilled at last.  And I will tell my story into nothingness and remember nothing.  I will gesso over the canvas, press the delete button, and move on,  because that is what I do well.  And if I think it hurts for just a moment, I will blame the moon.  And if you think truth is known when it is named, you are missing the picture.  There is no truth, just images from electrons that flash and burn oblivion soup.  THE REVIEW(S) IS/ARE INThe words are out in print for comment or not, and the judgement is not guilty  for now.  Decision hangs steady for three days running with little deviation in the story line.  Simple fool to be nothing better than or just something overlooked again.  The wonder of it all and the knowing is like a path.  I stopped on the walk, dropped to my knees and counted, curled like a fist, waiting for the moment past passed.  DISILLUSION MEANTThe moon plays tricks on my peace of mind and I am happily surprised by Pisces Balsamic curl of light.  Surprise is always happy.  Intentional change may present a few road blocks.  Tested and teased, I left my worries on the Bahamas  breeze, the sidewalk balcony outside my room with the mini golf view, and the buffet extravaganza.  The time to leave signals, a flash of lightening and the thunder is a smile.  Nine years passed without the pantyhose battle once brought into the open.  I wore flats and rose colored glasses in defiance of no one but myself in the end.  My reasons have changed but my soul has remained strong.  I have finally found the path I have been walking on all along.  WHEN YOU LEARNED OF MY NAME10 years ago was me to this place and nothing mattered much but that I could drink and the liquor store so close to my house and Food Lion for beer.  Still I wrote with feriocious intensity; love lost and forlorn of fantasies never formed.  And memories too; the drunken pounding of fingers to the keyboard on my new color screen computer.  I can remember sending you the poems though I can\\'t remember which ones they were or what you might have known when you learned of my name.  I was anybody else at the time and you didn\\'t know about all of the wine or how I came to men or who was why I am.  And I didn\\'t know you were someone real housed in a castle of empties casting your net onto the page from the Dead Man\\'s chair.  Conversations ensued we can not even remember, memory not being too important as the holy now and even now that is so.  There is no time and yet enough time, all of the world\\'s time and no roles or expectations to grow one\\'s hair long or shave off a beard.  Who we are now and what has been heard when nothing was said,  but still I wonder does he know and I hear him in my mind saying yes a thousand times I am saying nothing so loud, and even covering my smile poker faced as the dream is coming forward and the painting of the moon is mine and that school and that park and that is exactly yes and all the ashes in my car or the bowl of vomit left two days now at the foot of the table is nothing compared to nothing compared to nothing compared to.  (written 6:23 pm Saturday, April 12, 2003)  CONFIDENCEI am water. I am earth. My parents were fire and air.  I was pulled from the womb unwilling to face the birth canal when another option was possible.  It is always possible.  I come to you now on the verge of discovery. My sails are flowing and I am confident of this wind and this salt air, the canvas blowing filling with colors.  This confidence is like a gift and I appreciate and I endure;  weaving the strands into patterns into make believe and real and something warm to wear.  Life came to me  in summer and footy pajamas.  The fourth generation, baby Polish princess at the top of the aluminum siding castle.  There was a picnic table in the back yard. And my mother was air could she make them like her more by liking me enough.  And my father was fire over books and bad kitchen lighting to hook a career out of this place where he too was born.  We fled to the desert when I was three leaving snows behind and the oven my grandmother used to burn her children\\'s hands with when they were bad.  A new set of grandparents welcomed me like a second birth and there was a kitten for a friend, soon a pool, and a million books of witches and goblins and girls who knew magic.  My mother stayed inside with romance novels and melon ballers and sometimes gin and vermouth but always perfect; coming outside with cut up vegetables and hours working to please the palette of my Dad. She knew her role. She was air. She passed through.  And when I was good I was very very good and when I was bad I was horid.  Sweat pulled off in the dry heat like mirage as I waited for my father to get home to punish me for something done again to my mother.  He was fire. She was air and I was earth and water.  The tension and terror of the beating and having to do whatever she said or else.  This much I remember and nothing more will come to this page today.  I am lifted from the story in a giant helium balloon and carried up up up to the stars and evening night as the sunset hits camelback mountain and saguaros turn purple with goodnight.  (written 6:10 PM Saturday, April 12, 2003)  GLASSLight filtered through stained glass cave dwellings,  cool earth floor,  among the red rocks and chips of light break through like points on a map  when everything is warm and kind.  The rock is smooth in my hand, now edges jagged are merged with palm, tendered with lotion and love from all around, and above, beyond, below, beneath, besides, concerning, down, during, except, for, from.  The prepostion parade with clown horns and Shriners whizzing down the streets and squares of Savannah during the St. Patrick\\'s Parade;  and your apartment window two floors above the porta potty while people pissed green;  your stryrofoam head doll painted magical Mona and no idea of direction.  There was only the wind and the dandylions catching, scattering, dispersing, dancing.  Did we dance last night outside Nicotine, didgeridoo pulsing notes and I interrupted you to trace the painted footsteps, fucked up the numbers and turned towards you watching me learning.  But the clouds pass casting shadows layered like stacks of napkins spread in a fan at the bar; swizzle sticks, a rotating fan.  The film is rolling and nothing but everything I ever wanted stands in the way of here and now.  Already the vine is curling tender shoots reaching up like pipe cleaners to twist and play with suck on like ponytail braids and twirl around in the dress like every damsel in distress.  Good god.  May there be light, may there be inner peace and spritual growth for every one of these fuckers like me and you and everybody playing it cool or emptying giblets from paper packages to put in soup to flavor the broth.  I am down with mines and shoulds and sighs. I have enough belief in myself to let it ride \\'cause if the worst is down, that is what I am good at.  Spring is here. Step outside.

I must have been asking the wrong but how could I know and what made me think and maybe if and what about that and should I shouldn\\'t I would I could I  trust myself to even trust the universe as though stars represent some kind of why enough to make us feel small and I say  no again not this time  running jump and slide  your whole life is this dive down down deep  APPEARANCEPMS makes more sense than another 10 years of this goddamn job everyone says is so great because it pays the bills  so it goes  as he\\'d say  as for me I have had enough  as for me my last never is worked  I\\'d have to be out of my mind to stay another minute  I\\'d have to be drugged and sacked in burlap  Even that sounds like more fun than another drive on the turnpike  back and forth endlessly  making someone look good  IT ALWAYS COMES TO THISthe moment of flight  people parachutes  a lead weight a helium balloon  whispers from an alley a stern glance of disapproval  acceptance the unknown  trust shame  the ego\\'s despair  clutching grappling and dusting off  the cape  I CRADLE IFI cradle If and dress her up like dolls for girls to play with  I hold her hand at the end of the street and look both ways before crossing  Late at night I tuck her in with When and How beside her  If I were If I\\'d never know fuck is this cadence or what is this shit that\\'s happening  CROSSROADSPounding breath is shallow body thick and hard with tense hammering desire to quit to flee to love to be to stop copying and start creating to move on and find the path is still there winding to another crossroads somewhere further on  RSVPBusting out a tickle pins and needles inside below the rib cage  the urge is so strong to live to create to be become feel free  liberated at last  something unknown magnetic tractor beam pulling me towards the next step  life mapped out and the bread crumbs eaten by forest animals  body draped on the massage table while my neck is pulled and pushed left center right  scolded for wearing my shoulders around my neck and the woman\\'s pecs forgotten  hunching over from too much keyboard caressing  my fingers begin to curl  until at last reminded  death does not have to come by invitation  DIALOGUE WITH YOURSELFDid you expect to find me here in this location starting out at you  and we I mean you and I being you  you feel who you are talking to who is talking to you from behind these fingertips ever pressing and there is nothing but the abyss of bytes spewing data like stars the universe expanding exploding consciousness in batches recorded here for all to see  like blindness like turning away and what is visual is what is coming to screen  and I am alive here and with you as much as you will let me be  there is brightness illumination signalling and like a race to the finish  you are with me now and who am I but you  ALCOHOLICWeak, you drink your strength and become fermented and sour like substance, forever kicking yourself and those you love sober when you are a gentle man;  hard to remember when words are thick as phlegm, subtle as lead pipes against the head;  dissapointing like a lesson unasked for, unlearned,  and all that you were slips through fingers like the water from a poem somebody else wrote who thought he was you.  BETRAYED2:19 am birthed the Aries moon  while sleeping in my bed.  The morning broke through and I wake  to moving sidewalks, the others passing by and standing, and staring, until workday is done.  I leave the crowd behind to shuffle off  this day\\'s remorse, unmet, unmatched.  Daylight is sucked in  by the mouth of night, inhaled, one gulp,  embers, coals;  and it begins, the nightly ritual, a different sidewalk.  In the moment, you are all light and anything can happen;does.  You break the spell. You cast a shadow.  You are bitter and darker, fire and ice  side by side; driving me  to write.  You are a comfort to none but the man at the gas station who sold you the cans  and I am the fool again, manipulated, talked about, lied about, tossed around  like worth  as you  piss all over your fan club.  FINISHEDThat\\'s it. I have had enough of trying to relate, to change the world, to change myself, to make a difference, to make a dent.  BOOM  Let hope explode.  BOOM  Fireworks of faith.  BOOM  There\\'s nothing left. I have wasted my life living someone else\\'s dream, someone else\\'s expectations.  BOOM  I should be burned at the stake for treason.  BOOM  I should be nailed to the cross for my thoughts, kept inside again, repressed inside again, silent, useless, lonely, ugly, nothing golden bright to offer the universe.  BOOM  Time is running through my fingers and I don\\'t have the answers, these dubloons are melted chocolate stale Easter leftovers, and I am going to hell anyway for tempting married men when I had none of my own, for speaking out too seldom, for dragging my kindness through the coals like it\\'s nothing, like I am nothing to offer but down  while the wheels spin and the roar of the plane, and the polite way the passengers ignore eachother even when someone is screaming.  (written 4/27)  STAND BYDisillusioned I soar, a bird who has clipped her own wings, finding at last that I have no fire to offer the universe; it was yours all along.  Alone now I hide, with my gifts unwrapped, bowless, as if the universe cared for another utopian dream, a direction of love pointed to with an open heart by a mute.  And if my tears could turn this dry earth to mud, and if my soil could change the world, then throw me to the flame and let my ashes proof the clay between your hands.  I am nothing. I am no one, at last the liquid poured into sieve of self and gone.  What good is the desire to serve when desire only cuts and divides both halves.  There are pieces of me I will leave behind here, leaving my dreams unfulfilled, my faith in myself crushed by a fist, rumpled into a ball and tossed with so much other rubbish.  So this I will tell you when your voice is back, that I have failed, that I have faltered, that I have gazed into the mirror and reflected none of what you have seen, vision pissed into balloons and cast into the sea.  I am a whimper. I am a moth not a dragon, weak, withdrawn, to retreat to the cage of my fingers, to lock the door without a key.  And in the end, if one will come, I will remember nights without sleep, the weight of my passion, the pounding belief at my door that knocked and knocked and knew no peace.  My back was strong and inside much light, but thought orbits like stars, like earth around sun, the moon which never came, and no certainty as I watched my picture fade.  I knew at any time even now, I could stand, make a decision, and be strong again, bone and blood, but feelings like magnets hold me to this chair, and it is more true not to move now.  Like faucets, like data through cables and I divert my eyes from danger like God\\'s house or salvation, rather inside believing failure when uncertain success may come.  I resign my position of mood director.  I relinquish my smile at strangers, my mind the master, brandishing the whip at every indescretion or indecisive move. It hangs in my solar plexus like indigestion.  I have squandered my power. I have trusted that I could be you and made promises I can not keep.  I have buried myself with a toy shovel and lost my place and lost my way.  I spin and spin to gather speed, bursts of  dull light, explosions of average, my ego kicks and screams echoing down the well.  I will forgive no one, not myself, nor you, nor all of those gardners planting hope and despair.  Not even weeds could sprout through baked desert cracks in my soul.  Even the cactus gave up on rain and shriveled to a stick, thorns still sharp.  Nothing to guess at now, reality unveiled, my pathetic escape plans scrawled over  This is my weakness. Look at the man behind the curtain now, gaze upon her face.  I will ask none of you for help or hinderance, you have suckled me on lies foolish needy trusing lips to nipple, and the dead weight  of my aspirations, and the bullshit faith in my abilities, and the tears that well up now,  unable to keep it together  even for the hour and a half plane ride home.  (written 4/27)  OFF THE HOOKIt\\'s not even nine when there is an attempt to cop-opt my crisis; my story at last told, and everything hangs in air like dreams are not even possible.  The day passes in sleep and the strain of listening to numbers talk, screaming down columns in an Excel spreadsheet 5 cups of coffee can not even animate.  Freedom charges another debit against my account and the messenger hits the floor before the bullets fly.  (written 5/21)  BEFORE AND AFTER The rain taps its fingers on the tin roof above my patio,  keeping me from a drive North to  Melbourne to check in, luggage in hand,  another night out  before  a morning meeting, and a few words, and a few notes, and a  drive West to  Tampa to check in, luggage in hand, andanother night out.  FOR PHILYou took a photo of me in stars, black back, and rain dripping down the screened porch.  You gave me comfort but I could not receive.  There were too many thoughts of goodbyes from others ringing in my ears for me to hear what you were saying.  I am surrounded by the aged and forget my youth from time to time.  IN VAINThere is nothing I have to say that hasn\\'t been felt by someone else and this is my good fortune.  All of the angst and doubt and questions are not in vain if written down and someone should pick up the pieces to rest her head a while.  Some nights it is not so easy to sleep without a pillow.  WILLINGAnd out of nowhere and everywhere, all is right with the universe and you are back.  I am green haired, laughing, young, hanging on the swimming pool ladder, catching my breath as yours whispers through the line.  Every moment, back and new in the complexity of an almost no.  I understand without.  You remind me so much with every word how yes there is a now, there is a connection we all experience down, and because such love is required, such tenderness that I know from you for everyone in your gentle stories.  The magic you convey is possible in the moment, every moment.  I am singing in these words. I am dancing the steps painted on the sidewalk.  Take my arm in yours. I am willing.  CLOSE CORRESPONDENCESilence starting and already I imagine trips to the mailbox, but what the fuck, and why  am I missing something here that has kept my mouth shut tight like duct tape over lips against a terrorist threat.  Light another. Smoke another.  Get this out of my head and down where I can understand nothing better than big talk from someone else,  while I sit and observe, while I sit and perceive.  I am whipped into submission by my reflection.  My tawdry alter ego, the no show, readied for my finale as a failure and no head for numbers, so what will become of me...  I have three days left before I can be myself again and nobody will be there on the other side to hear it.  What have I done and why should I care if I don\\'t don\\'t care when I\\'m my own nurse writing prescriptions, before the Third Bardo.  For all the promises made to send to me, now will the letters come?  What do you care and why should you care when I am just another stranger or reminder that you have heard everything before and probably said much better.  Is that jealousy?  I have nothing to offer but breath and that which comes natural to dissipate every energy landing here.  Doubt, fear, shame.  This is nothing to contribute and I can\\'t get by on my tits, my looks faded at 5 years old and I\\'m lucky to hear cute anymore.  Responsible, dependable me.  Why can\\'t I just be alone where no shadows play across the walls I don\\'t cast myself.  Why can\\'t I just be alone and not hear your voice or wonder and wait by the mailbox for something not coming out here now to tell me the truth.  4:05 AM Friday, June 27, 2003  HOW DARKThis dramatic ending was courtesy of T-Mobile.  Sixty seconds on Bradley\\'s phone explained nothing.  I am a greyhound let loose after the rabbit, carting your newest disciple behind me.  Thoughts of this and who I am spark, and you don\\'t know how dark my cloud is.  Back at home, wondering who this father he thinks you are is, and you don\\'t know how dark my cloud is.  Pieces fly and the jig saw changes the shape on the way down.  I am powerless watching this story play out in not the way I feel.  And I question every question I questioned and the answers that sound different the second time rewound, and you don\\'t know how dark my cloud is.  The line to you is cut and words can only get me into trouble later or sooner if I send them.  This is not my half. This is not my whole. This is not my job, my problem, my passion, my possession.  I am lightning. Look at the path.  I am the moon reflected in a pail. Look up.  All my words and all my sorrows have already been taken, and you don\\'t know how dark my cloud is.  Go ahead and choose another title for this  meaning less.  It will take longer to explain the sound of my own voice this time.  2:55 AM Friday, June 27, 2003  HEATHENThese are not the keys I wanted to press 65 days in.  This is not the Sunday afterwards I wanted to spend with you.  I am a balloon that\\'s been deflating for years.  Nobody said anything.  Isn\\'t now too late to raise my hand for air?  This is not the song I expected to be playing for you this month.  This is not the book I wanted to read when I finally let go.  What makes you think you are so special?  What gives you the right to judge and complain?  I am a television series all to myself.  I want to tell my friends to stop right where they are and let me get this down on paper or where is that camera, tape recorder, something.  This is what I am supposed to remember.  Interesting is even better than saved.  BETWEEN THE NOTESI remember talking with you at the table, you in your assigned place, and me in mine, even though the parents were gone.  You told me I was too young to think about things like the meaning of life,  or what my purpose here  would be.  You are supposed to be out having fun, you told me, and I would ask you  what if thinking about these things was my idea of fun.  I could barely convince myself and you never hid your pity for my petty struggle to find and an answer. between the notes in our conversation.  EQUINOXTommorrow is off, put on hold; faith, hope, and love are shelved cans of film, and the jar of ideas is filled with brine awaiting  a different  freedom.  This summer equinox knocks to find me barely awake at its passing and  cursing the light that won\\'t heal another\\'s suffering.  It has rained all day and you tell me 600 persons were evacuated in the flooding when we talk.  There are no fire flies this far into the city anyway and even if the grasses were dry the crickets would not grind any softer.  I have been promised that the meaning of life is time by an uncle I got drunk a dozen Christmasses ago.  I immerse myself in it like a bath of gravy and barely float.  I shovel the walk of it every morning when I wake and notice its passing when the last quarter moon rises behind the clouds.  Decades too young to retire from life, I give up anyway.  I stand accused of dreaming of a world too good  to be real.  Evidence is presented without a spell check in great abundance for the good of the masses.  They tell me their fears and wish me well enough alone, trapped in prisons of their own regret.  I stand inside my cell tonight because I know my way around here even in the dark.  WRITINGAlways arriving like an itch nothing can scratch;  not mind, nor hopes, nor mindless cleaning, straightening for the the creation that comes from fingertips,  The night is longer still ahead of me, like wine, like water from glasses played for an audience;  different levels of liquid to appoximate the voice or a guitar left playing by itself, fingers strumming with nobody to hold the instrument.  VIGILThere are moments when joy doesn\\'t come and all of the talk of God and peace does not fit the hole.  Even faith in the internet shatters under search terms not found.  The emptiness is vast without content.  The void is highlighted in gold and  over and over again outside it sounds like thunder or the sound of trash cans rolled out for the night, planning for the morning when time stands on end, static electricity in hair, the gong sounds.  Time\\'s up.  PRINCESSSometimes she can sweep the pages into nothingness; into an eight ball corner pocket, stuffed with her short attention span for present details.  The past ruffles its feathers against  the girl with a lifetime (still short) of boxes filled with collections of what  can not be bought.  Dreams may come, and she may call names  out into the darkness like memory cares enough to answer her at all.  She asks if true love is as real as stars or bright  planetary nebulae, a fuel that burns to tell us something  about our own origins.  All remembered at once, it is sudden as  dissapoint ment  and the gravity of a single misplaced thought, found still searching for the pea under her matress.  WORKAHOLICAnother sun sets as you stab at your keyboard, fingers drumming replies to the boomerang burst of emails you must answer.  In only a few moments, the time for dinner will have passed, all movies will have already begun, and all of your friends will be in the thick of their plans for the night.  You may believe in the urgency of the greater cause the company has instilled in you, and the idea  of your place in this world from which there is no  clocking out.  So wake at dawn to work but know in the end it is nothing.  The time will come where death  will rock your boat, the loss of a loved one  leaving an anchor deep under your waves, and you will wonder where all those sunsets went and why you were not there to hold her hand at starlight.  You will find that all those trips for work meant nothing, are not even remembered, and even the money left behind is too weak to keep you floating.  Begin to tread now, and gather your strength. Pick up your sail and work with the wind this time, for love is more than greed will ever buy.  You will never be important enough or have enough proof of your worth through any job or any title.  It is quicksand to your self and no matter how much it eats of your soul it will never be full.  Forgive yourself the times you made others do your work so you could ride the corporate coaster.  Forgive yourself the times you couldn\\'t be there because you thought you were too important.  Forgive yourself now for truth does not come easy and without a lesson.  There are many oceans ahead of you to call your home now that you know.  AFTER A DAY AT HOSPICEHow slowly these stages pass, how gradual a slope, and we too are learning while the summer passes by without our concern.  The days lengthen and stretch beyond us while we too  are blanketed by the nurses in kindness and patience.  With Grandma there are moments where she lets me know  with the grip of her hand, she is still here.  Sometimes there is a smile, beautiful beyond skies.  There have been days too where she has comforted me when weak,  my tears falling unashamed by my love for this woman who has given me so much acceptance and concern, a gentle respect for simple truths.  I remember weeks ago, hot from the walk to the Hospice house, I came to her and took her hands in mine. With silence she drew them  to her lips  to blow them cool.  This is love.  It is here I have learned tenderness. It is here I have learned care. These are my thoughts riding my bike home, thanking my legs, my heart, my health.  Home, I hesitate doing what would make me feel good because even the tension in my  shoulders,  neck,  face, reminds me that  you are still here. There is so little time now  for other souvenirs; memories made, forgiveness granted,  and night passes on to another day of lessons and farewells.  ONLY IN DREAMSWhy must love be for another when it can not be against?  Last week I was your lover, wife, favorite friend, and child\\'s mother.  You came to my door with words I long to hear, having scripted them so meticulously, missing nothing.  We spoke from the heart and dreamed in color, filling the skies, traveling through deserts and on high mountain roads.  I gave you the resume of my heart, objective clear, and you responded in delight.  Pity you were not there to experience any of it.  Why must love be for another when it can not be against?  BEFORE THE CREDITSMaybe the answer is to belong nowhere; let time ride over your back like rain falling through a patch of sun, sing your song into the night to harmonize with locusts, breathe, embrace moments even spent in woods, and if a tree falls then who cares.  There have been crueler summers, the time to let my heart out to play, learning there is beauty too in suffering.  I am more than less I was as dogs bark and the room is still save the ceiling fan having it\\'s own gentle caress on my shoulders.  I bleed willingly, joyfully, believing in magic over cold logic and thoughts dancing, meaning nothing.  Real is as real does. The movie playing in my mind is a double feature. I order vegetable foo young and select this seat.  THERE\\'S NO PLACE LIKEFor seven years I have lived next door to a mermaid.  At night, she hangs her tails from the line stretched across her car port.  I know her name and she knows mine.  The rest of my neighbors are strangers, stranger still these days filling spaces with SUVs and children taken in hand.  I have outgrown this home and am outclassed, and am outmortgaged, and am outside taking the recycling out for Friday wondering how it all got so different from me.  CUT THE STRINGI imagine I will always have this feeling of vague dissastisfaction.  One minute there is endless opportunity, the goal is in sight, then the finish line, then nothing left to cross.  I remind myself.  Another ending is near, and in the end it doesn\\'t ever matter how good it all sounded then.  I have people to face and balls of yarn to unravel, trim, and snip off.  Perfection isn\\'t possible and what are dreams for if not to wake from.  I seek a new path to absorb myself into.  I will avoid those who suffer from self-importance this time.  I have paid for my admittance to this show in more ways than one.  July is change and letting go and the universe seems a lot more trustworthy to me than people if I am any example.  The balloon rises into the sky and is caught by the wind up, up, up.  CLOSERHolding in feelings, drawn and quartered by possible fantasies and improbable futures, I am in wonder and awe.  She gave me a sample bottle of perfume called Miracle to use for such adventures but so far no water has turned to wine.  I am beside myself, inside myself, rehearsing and rehashing, afraid to pick up the phone to call you in the event it may ring.  You are living in a different time I know too well to pretend now my minutes pass the same as yours, measured for mixing in metric increments.  The window of opportunity this time is known and days pass towards your arrival as though leaning forward.  I am unsure about all but my feelings and what I am willing to sacrifice in their name.  Such statements come easy but I am all about the imagined.  It is what I know, eyes full of stars, and an inner knowing of just how the moon will look tonight rising above water.  GO ONFor five days, I have been without my mirror.  I guess if this shirt looks right with this skirt with this look, sideways glancing, is this really me?  It is spring at the piñata party. My amnesia has lifted  from the time I was hit by the bat. I am looking around at all the kids.  Tonight even the poet asks where the moon is and in Gemini, even I look rational.  Thoughts stretch out in the sun and flip.  Everyone else has found the answers but me.  I have spent my life interviewing the wrong  person.  STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESSIf I could quiet my thoughts, wrap the bundle in  soft and warm, to crib for naps or watching stars,  would the unknown make itself a little less obvious?  All day I have been beyond behind wonder and not knowing, pretending bliss,  the gift of lack of commitment.  I am too far removed and too soon confused.  I am missing out on missing out.  Could there be a balance in geography, a new spot to look on the map, easier on the neck?  Snap around and fall  in line?  I am breaking the rules still but  still not enough.  And in a round, my generation sings.  We apologize to all of those who have sacrificed their lives in the hope we would be more than what we have become.  You should have asked us first what we were capable of.  GROWING WINGSLike an outpouring from the void, not even knowing what will be said next, it all comes together in a chorus of what to dos.  The eternal question of being strong enough for someone else too, you ask without a question mark.  There is always fear of never being enough for these mistakes offered up like proof.  I have not turned the air conditioner on since I have been home, a someplace I have been before, which surrounds me like a fog that does not come up through the trees at seven o\\'clock in the morning.  CLUES AND ILLUSIONSAt this point it doesn\\'t really matter what I say to sound coming off like a nothing, something, maybe more or less, not.  These images flash, and I am unsure again of who I  was when I was what I was,  to be found this close to home without a conscience carved in honest mistakes.  Best wait for something resembling silence to take the place of feeling out of place, pointed at.  No competition is worth having.  We were meaning something even I can\\'t understand;  like a song going through your head that won\\'t quit and singing it to someone else only makes it worse.  A spotlight on the stage or behind walls is more or less the same.  Burn out the light by leaving it on too long or shadow this crevasse into camouflage.  It makes no difference.  Words must come out somewhere after all and targets are slow to come by.  To know oneself as a monster and angel containing equal parts is a poorly bargained balance.  Deny nothing. Keep to yourself.  Keep your hands in the car at all times.  Rhetoric and righteousness from too shaky a foundation, is roughness  and  sand castles.  What could you have been if you had just been you, if you\\'d only known that then?  Who else do you expect to forgive and forget the truth of  too much from too much?  It all comes out in the wash said someone helping even now, in ways I can not see, in ways I can not see.  ONLY STARTSIn the in between,  between fear and flight,  choices breeze through chance, opportunities tease,  and  voices never echo the same through the open door,  closed by passers by.  Single light switch, socket, the pulsating electric puzzle, writhing like  tommorow;  procrastination finely tuned for the recital;  Mars coming closer to earth than what could mean something wrong.  The planets rarely align for despair or disasters yet to come.  More is wished into the energy vacuum than all the worlds pennies buying nothing these days.  Paint over the mess you thought you made with your life.  Pull off that protective vinyl cover.  The suits were made for flight and in the end, it\\'s only starts.  STILL NOT COMING BACKI could probably stay awake for the rest of my life in frenzied marathon poetry writing.  It started as a tickle, or a gash, I felt after purging my home of your wood.  Big trash day is coming to take away the rest of you and I returned all of your memories before asking you to please go; you will never do, you will never do.  And as I boast of my pain, I can only imagine what fears take hold of you as you drive away again always never turning back to take me into you arms.  You apologized to me when we parted from our embrace this afternoon.  \"I am sorry I am not what you need,\" you assured me as you let me go.  You never knew that all I asked of you was to keep holding me just a little longer, but knowing that was not worth the asking.  written 8/4/03 4:25amAND THEY ARE OFFI write without stopping like someone has shot a gun and the race is on.  To be fair, I allow for breaks this time.  To be proper, I forgive those  critics whose  jobs were to set me straight on a number of important details  such as;  creativity is all well and good but keep within the established rules,  and  love is a blessing even when you don\\'t exactly have it in the way that you thought about it,  and hey what about a little fucking humor  from time to time to break through.  Because I have gone back now in time and read your words,  and they were not meant even for me here feet on table, legs slagging over the edge, cigarette smoked, and getting smaller again, as I am want  to do once I get too full of myself.  I am wiser now by far then the girl I was.  Nothing is quite so dark and grim and I never talk about hell anymore so it must be resolved.  I mortared many bricks to build this fine home using tools I was well taught  duty  loyalty  obligation  sacrifice  They paid the bills and brought me hunks of marked acrylic with my name in the center.  Let someone else get the applause. It wasn\\'t all that and in the end less mattered than I might have thought once I awakened to the reality of who I was sleeping inside those realtor looking jackets and sweating leather flats I kept in abundance in the trunk of my car in case I were to forget to wear shoes to work again. written 8/4/03 4:12 am  GUSTSAnother wind blows me into the tunnel; the concrete pipe kids crawl in and out of, but I stayed.  I claimed the walls as my own still refusing birth.  Inside, I asked the others to tell me the truth and they did.  They were too slow to come up with any questions for me and nobody could match my hours of practice asking questions into the void, the abyss that fed me mother\\'s milk while I scrawled marks on the walls to measure time.  It\\'s all here, all of my secrets revealed again, and if I forget another time then yes, again, I will seal the capsule with packing tape one more time and cast my bottle into the sea.  written 8/4/03 3:53 am  LOOPExpression of which is covered over begs for approval removal.  All your life you have known who you really are.  Sometimes it bubbles to the surface like translucence rainbowing in the sun.  Sometimes it pricks like a pebble  in an ice skate laced up tight, buried layers  deep down in the sock.  You never really cared  to own your own laughter or delight shared with others still fearing their own shadows, but La Ventana is open wide, proof enough that water can wear down the earth.  Wind too, can wash away the strongest stone.  Emanate and luminate past the stairs of wonder. Even the way down is up from here.  You are here on  temporary assignment on a fixed track, in the last car, approaching the final climb.  Throw your arms wide into the sky and squeal your way to the end.  You have an all day pass from here on out.  CLOSER UPTo whom may you sacrifice your needs to prove?  For whom do you toil and ponder nights spent awake, easing the way for dawn?  Letting go these images, the after burn of dreams, edges petal crisp, pixilated closer up, eat dot made from another pattern.  Whose timeline serves you best? Have you chosen your master well? Do you seek another\\'s hands on your will?  The time will not come  for you to ask  these questions again, in this way, or with this urgency of command.  Relinquish the lust for results, acknowledging the answers given you didn\\'t ask for.  Nothing can slip through fingers, even held tight, like impatience when a tunnel is bored into the earth or the flesh for a break through centuries overdrawn.  ON PURPOSEIn times of fear, we all fall back on what we think we know to be our strengths when our weakness  makes us more human.  In a robot vision of life, in step with the crowd or with those breaking free, all of the indecisions are abandoned for better distractions.  In the microwaveable vision of life, time is saved by not wondering purpose or planning for trips not yet taken;  and everyone has answers they are willing to share.  The meaning of life is waiting for you at the convenience store up the street, from the man you see everyday who may not even know your name or the brand you buy;  and everyone has answers they refuse to speak of.  They have a lot to do with that (w)hole you are trying so hard to fill.  So...  Dance to another man\\'s beat.  Sing the lyrics you didn\\'t write.  Stare into the photo you didn\\'t take.  Creativity is for what practical purpose anyway or should that question anchor  elsewhere.  Creativity is for what conversation going on under the surface, projecting as anger or disagreement, or a million things not talked about because there is one thing still undiscussed.  What if you were the answer?  What if you were the center?  Commitment is  even harder to make to ones self than  to another when stubbornly, the dream refuses to let go when the alarm clock goes off, and  still nothing to do on purpose.  WAVE PARTICLESTired of sustaining the illusion, she cracks another whip and the music resumes,  Lonlied by me, my and mine, she parts the waves  to bring the boats to shore a prettier face  could have launched into battle.  The night slides into tomorrow, skids past midnight, then thud.  A few pieces are still missing from next week.  Destiny calls and a few are left on hold for way too long.  Apologies inner tube down the river in tank tops and flip flops.  The window of opportunity was dangled before the point of no return and all of the crickets left for better acoustics someplace else.  So what to stay and retrieve... the soul.  So what to stay and believe... the soul.Nothing matters more than (fill in the blank) filtered through sand.  THE MOON WAS STILL UPAnger and pain I can not understand because they are so far underneath your skin even poetry does not release from you their rewards.  You compete against the music played to drown you out on purpose as though guitar light could flood the landscape yesterday bright or for pieces of the puzzle glued on cardboard to signify an end.  Struggle is synthesized into the equalizing waves of water washing over a brand new day and you are the  lighthouse again against rocky shores.  Memory unlatches the paper petroglyphs at exactly the right time even though the words are too faint to hear over the lyrics of Van Morrison or the possibility of being completely wrong about all of it.DISSEMINATING ARIESEven though the night fades, I hold the connection like sunrise sings the moon to sleep and drives truth into hiding for memories of future hopes of meaning.  Nothing has come true yet but it doesn\\'t matter.  As long as there is breath to explain the similarities of shadows passed in misdemeanors of youth\\'s lost excuses for being someone.  Regulating behavior is completely within the rights of the individual or so the law states.  Guidelines are drawn out poster big and glossy or matte depending on the given day or what can be given.  The stand still between answers to questions posed or swords drawn for a fight to the death of the ego.  Not everyone was famous in their past lives and some of us even are supposed to be who we are exactly as we are right now regardless of who likes it, and those that do.  Those who will be with us always are no less worthy of lifting up into truths known by all to be remembered by some.  The burden of keeping silent is celebrated only at the first sign of sound.  And though there may be more than nothing to it, I am found here in your loss more than you were known to be like me, straightening my spine as rainbows climb my back.  BACK AND FORTHThere have been truths told and promises broken over and over again like time passes through street corners summer has neglected and passed her judgment on before songs stop the conversations going nowhere.  The middle path is a reminder and echoes fly like hawks high above La Ventana calling me home as time is marked in different countries.  Over everything and nothing, no blame comes; the farewells are predicted in tea leaves, the strained voice of someone knowing there is nothing so something as the peach tree orchard of lost virginities and misled suitors looking for magic, rabbits dead in the hat.  The next song starts on speaker phone and she is beyond understanding his control or the drummer boy playing in the background without frankincense or louder still to drown out fingers stretching across time.  He asks her if she has found enlightenment yet or if she knows what love is.  In this state or that. with control, or without control, or with the knowing glances, the smiles at men with chests pressed out.  The owl that came to her on the patio looked in her eyes for truth before the matter was examined, and we heard the same music for the first time pretending it was not the second time this has not happened before or it was not the first time this has happened again before  air on the neck, the ceiling fan, the fan on the floor, the wind that calls from canyons in Farmington, secrets of not giving yourself completely enough over until the end.  MILAREPA\\'S DANCEMaybe dreams are just the  overreaching of money\\'s excuse for not being real enough or owning pain rented out.  My grandmother was dying as the paid nurse held her hand and  I asked my Mother if this is what money buys.  In silent shame I knew  the truth no books  are bold enough to hold  the words for.  I am born of this wound made in the earth by accident.  I look to the sky for answers in the clouds free to all.  I look to the sky for the moon rising, reliable as egg letting go of womb.  She is the woman he is looking for and he doesn\\'t believe she exists.Even still her hands stretch out, thumb and forefinger holding the fragile peace.  Even still her breathing lights up the room darker than he knows reaching out in ways he can not see, can only feel and she understands.  I COME TO THE DESERTI come to the desert  to find my past, reconnect with roots  buried in hard soil played on in childhood, Creosote smells foretelling distant rain the heat evaporates before landing.  I come to the desert  to find my past, branches of my heart dried like cactus bones, asking acceptance from this earth or these Indian eyes, or these Mexican smiles, who glance over me like forgiveness is all I can earn here under this white skin.  White like klan robes, white like eyes opened wide, white like lies told for victories never won in justice.  I come to the desert  to find my past at the National Atomic Museum, and learn about Nobel scientists, skin mushroom cloud white like mine, and I am demanding to know the half-life of truth.  I come to the desert  to find my past at the Pueblo museum in plaques defining 19 tribes, each with a paragraph describing their survival among the greed of conquerors using God as a weapon with skin white like mine.  I come to the desert to find my people at the museum  of Hate and Intolerance, but the gates are closed, guarded by silent kachinas skin bright and bold, not white like mine.  I come to the desert  to find my purpose at a poetry reading, revealing injustices and lost identities boiled down in this melting pot and listen  as though in the truth  of another, some answer may be found, but in an instant am shattered when a note scrawled on napkin is passed to me, \"This is not Starbuck\\'s,\" a message for skin white like mine.  I come to the desert  to find my homeland  for I am removed  three generations from my name.  Perhaps it would be better to find my past in the Polish family who came to this United States to escape their torturers and build generations who could speak the language, who would not have to break backs  and cramp fingers in the tobacco fields, picking and sweating and laying leaves across wood to dry.  I am told these were my people, strangers to me, I was carried away to the desert when I was three. I was not told their stories until the summer Stasia took me to Chu Chu\\'s to hear her memories of being in the Catholic concentration camp with her son Billy.  It was seven years  before they escaped, after the war was over,  but before liberation came.  I come to the desert because these stories do not truly belong to me, and I cannot find comfort in Chu Chu\\'s words at the end of her tale, \"the Jews deserved it,\" her ancient face revealing eyes still unforgiving, betraying her frailty.  She was dead four years before I was told.  So I come to the desert, seeking community and culture only tasted at restaurants, licking my lips, the color on my body and deny my race, for I am not white, I am beige, beige like these desert sands, beige like these hard rock mountains.  I am beige in the sun.  I darken my skin in the shadows.  I stand alone, the last of my family line, the family who worked to give me the freedom  to buy a new history for myself among the madness of conquerors  enslavers liars murderers skin white  like the blisters  on my beige  heels, as I walk the desert to find  the sacred space to heal  my common humanity.  SOMEPLACE NEW AGAINI have had it with trolling for visions. The fish never bite and  I feel kind of funny pulling them up from the depths, considering the bends and all.  Though flashy colors and neon  have always caught my fancy, I realize there is more to pretty than that which remains when eyes  are closed.  Life is everywhere and I am.  Life is a kaleidoscope and I am up late feeling  the magic of dreams cast by my neighbors, and happiness  is found in simply being happy.  After all,  freedom isn\\'t about freeing everyone else.  Let everyone find his own cloud monsters and  try to break them up with the power of his will alone.  Let everybody find her own set of flannel sheets to sleep comfortably at night.  We ride our bikes on parallel paths and I am  no more than just a few inches from you.  We climb our mountains with the same  weight of gravity tugging at our boots and I have no idea if this rope will hold.  The end result is never really an ending, but begin here just in case you think you have arrived someplace new again.  FROM FLAMESIf there were an answer, then the questions would stop, and with nothing left to ask, only silence could recognize you.  I have reached to the stars, I have followed shamans to their sleeping shadows, passed the sighs of discontent, crept down stairs of sameness, felt the pains of misunderstood strangers wanting to be loved for that spark of light the others ignored in them.  I dusted them off  and shined them up, as though God cared for something cleaner than strength while night folded in on itself, while time marked herself with one leg raised and love rested unrequited for a while.  What\\'s not to be afraid of for those who wait for even the first step  to emerge from the abyss or  their leg to twitch  towards liberation.  I followed that map to oblivion time and time again  until I realized it was only  a representation.  I gagged and bound my ego in retribution and drove past the dream of being more than myself by being the Self, the ultimate trip up down the path of illusory greatness.  Still the songs played on like trickling fingertips  on skin, light and playful and  wanting.  Still the lyrics illuminated the more than enoughness  of love regardless  of regard.  And night folded in on herself, marking time with man made clocks towards our own (un)timely demise or  time to arise from these flames like the Phoenix with brightly colored wings who flies because she can.  Flap, flap, flap.  A STEP CLOSER TO STEPPING OFFVoices raised like hands above heads, like waves  of fingers piano playing the air, accidental harmonies wanting  an end or just wanting  more.  The world spins out of synch, faster and hotter, like water spills like steam rises, like warm mud  or the soft underbellies of earth worms, making their way home while everybody goes about his business.  Drums beat to  mark the passage; the young girls dance while the boys look on, ying and yang pushed to a crescendo, cutting through the cage, as if victory is nothing more  than  a barrier breached again  and again.  For whose benefit are these metaphors and significances and coincidences?  For whose reward are these smiles and knowing winks and a nudge and a nudge and a nudge?  Wrong, wrong, wrong but will  we know right  when we see it?  Bad, bad, bad but will we know good when we see it?  The opposites define themselves into each other, merging and melting into the mud, and the earthworms go about their business, while everybody makes her way home.  The shouting turns to singing, turns to whispers, turns to laughter, turns to silence and then a rest between notes.  GERMINATIONThe flowers you gave me are beginning  to open on my window sill; red rose taking on a new shape as the day progresses, overpowering the black-eyed susans.  As a gift to Spot, I bring the vase out to the patio where he sprawls  in catlike bliss on the current dining room table.  Stretching out, he purrs, rubbing his face into the leaves, losing his balance in wonder over the smells, and the leaves, and the tiny yellow petals reaching out from their branches  until a lizard catches his eye and it\\'s just me here, remembering the bouquet held in your hands the night before  last.  RIGHT NOWletting it all come and go and flow without regard to time or spaces between us and  even words and even dreams and even and even  gentle strength  learning not to direct the waves but to sink soar rise the crest and soft back into petals  those times when you are not and those times when you are  the right balance towards upwards the middle path and back down casting no rings on the water  emergence and separationIn no time at all and all time, the words from fingertips are creeping to the surface.  Cross the bridge, open the gate;  and it\\'s all countless tribes of butterflies and  the passing  from moon, to sun, to moon, to sun, only clouds can deny the eye.  TOO LATENot writing has become a metaphor for my life; instead of finished work behind me, ahead lies scraps of started interrupted thoughts, leading to what is unknown at present;  and I am behind myself, watching like talons underfoot tickle gashes, moving still under currents, thoughtless, running from something, giving up the dream again all too soon, again all too late to never finish the painting or poem.  What half am I trying so hard to whole with;  complete my self, male, female, animal;  and  planets spin and align, and astrologers interpret for the apathetic masses.  I shined too bright to be believable and when daybreak crashed against the bedroom wall, I was too hungry for the comfort and warmth of eyes and arms and legs to wrap around to tell the truth to even myself;  finding out too late, just as good as never finding out at all.  UNWRAPPEDYesterday afternoon, we weeded  our first garden and  tilled the soil.  Now each  breath we take  is a greater symbol  than jumping  from a plane.  Your fingers touch mine and  the perfect fit of the palms together are more  than two breaths finding rhythm.  Each day more is unwrapped and contents  spill from morning, to afternoon, to evening.  I am below and above and beside it all, looking forward as if  it\\'s the first time that direction  ever existed for me at all.  Cloud  SpaceDuring the time when you have not  yet been to life or death;  everything everyone told you was important;  still  is.  Dreams are something to interpret to find your inner questions.  All purposes must have a goal at the end to cross and the sooner, the better.  You have not yet seen the bricks.  Cloud space on blue sky that should be white.  What is clear but the absence of something blocking.  Less to edit endlessly in the head and  the players still seeming to act from a different script.  Before the veil is lifted, before it is too indescribably beautiful to believe, innocent as the smooth skin on the side of a blade of grass, and you might even forget sometimes to look at the sunset or to remember when the moon will next be full.  Easier  to love in another while simply passing through the absence of clouds.  reflecting the sunIn what ways does life change; thoughts going through and out alongside 64 violins the night the spiritual leader of Palestine was assassinated, just holding  your hand;  to go forward with a dream lived now,  in even the journey north  together;  just to see your face in the morning,  again and again;  and warm skin touching somewhere before sleeping positions are established.  So many stories still untold and  a language left to learn and experiences to share;  while the Aries moon scatters her seeds into  the earth;  rises, wispy outline but still there  reflecting the sun.  BACK FROM NOWHEREFor weeks the wind has been howling backwards, blowing not a leaf but the sound and  the rumble inside is like a passing train.  The whistle never blows here in this town too far from major arteries; still there are tracks to cross back and forth and  harder  on a bike.  And this is home now.  I keep reminding myself how happy I am to have so much shade again.

The Earth is astronomically poised between the Sun and the Moon, enabling us to see two different sides of ourselves clearly, something the Gemini energy is adept at spotting. The opposing but equally-pulling gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon also reveals a tension within ourselves. The polarity of Gemini is Sagittarius.The polarity of a sign, is the sign that is opposite it in the zodiac. Since we are in the Sagittarius lunar cycle, that tension may be more pronounced.  By providing enough distance and light to give us an objective view of ourselves and how we relate to others, the Full Moon works to integrate and harmonize the contradictions in ourselves and others. This opening of increased awareness traditionally makes the Full Moon a beneficial time for meditation on personal and worldwide issues. There\\'s literally an electrical energy build-up before a Full Moon and a release just after the peak. At the Full Moon, the seeds sown at the last New Moon are ready to be harvested and used ~~ we reap what we\\'ve sown. Working out the energy through the physical body can be grounding and centering. About Gemini (Ruler Mercury):The Astrological Symbol of Gemini is the Twins. Like their sign, the twins, they often have a dual nature and are skilled at seeing both sides of a problem, but they may also be fickle and restless.  Within the Zodiac, Gemini is opposite Sagittarius, the sign of philosophy. While Sagittarius tends to have one major interest that is studied deeply, Gemini people tend to have many different interests they study in less detail.  The element of Gemini is air. Air is vital to human survival. Without air, we would perish. Air is the power of movement; of freshening and of intellignce. It\\x92s the invisible and yet quite real mixture of gases that we breathe in every day. The three air signs are Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. In astrology, air stands for intellect, reason and communication. The quality of Gemini is mutable. The four mutable signs Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. In astrology, the mutable quality signifies versatility, adaptability, openness to change, and flexibility.Gemini - Full Moon Meditationfrom  urlLink The Labours of Hercules «I recognize my other self and while this fades I grow and glow.» (May 21 - June 20)  This full moon meditation series is based on an astrological interpretation of the twelve labors of Hercules from the Greek myth. The twelve tasks of Hercules are symbolic lessons for every human from the way of selfishness back to the Heart of God. As mortals we do not exactly know the way to the higher worlds but the path itself knows and leads us through sometimes dramatic experiences to our goal. So we travel \"on the path until we become that path\", from Aries to Taurus and Gemini - and further through all the astrological signs to Pisces. In Gemini active work sets the standard tone. First comes the premonition, later the certain knowledge; eventually we recognize through daily work - after mental control in Aries and overcome desire in Taurus - the light of God everywhere.  In the third sign of the astrological year, Gemini, the Twins, Hercules is called again from his own inner light to go further and accept the next task: Go out to search the sacred tree and gather the golden apples of the Hesperides. Unfold the power to search without discouragement, deception or too great speed. Perseverance holds the key.  The task appears to be easy and Hercules hurries into it. But the garden of the Hesperides is protected by a hundred-headed dragon and three virgins. Throughout the land Hercules passes, seeking the sacred tree, but without success. He is deaf to the inner voice and blind for all signs along the way. From North he turns to South and wrestles with Antaeus, the serpent in the place of darkness. Antaeus overcomes him at every point until Hercules is able to lift the serpent, with both arms, high in the air, off from the ground. To the West Hercules now turns with new courage. He meets Busiris, the great deceiver, son of the waters, who pretends to know the truth alone. Hercules loves and adores Busiris, follows him and becomes bound by him for a whole year. Finally Hercules turns inwards and realises that \"Truth lies within yourself\". So he breaks the bonds and continues with the search wiser than before. A pain-filled screem intrudes the ear of Hercules, the one of Prometheus, chained upon a rock, his liver being hacked by vultures, thus slowly killing him. Hercules breaks the binding chain, frees Prometheus und looks after him until he recovers from his wounds. With much loss of time Hercules turns to the high mountains of the East, meeting Atlas on his way carrying the load of worlds upon his back. Hercules watches and gauges the measure of the load and pain. He forgets about his search and decides to aid the giant without delay. So he shoulders the burden of his brother unto his own back. But lo! the load rolls off and he stands free and likewise Atlas. From the loving hands of Atlas he gets the long awaited golden apples. Three sisters - Aegle, Erythea and Hesperis - await him with more apples declaring \"The Way to us is always marked by service. Deed of love are signposts on the Way\". The story ends with Hercules returning the apples to the three sisters \"for those who follow\".  The sign of Gemini consists of two pillars connected with a half-moon shaped arch: One pillar is open at the bottom, the other at the top. They symbolise the lower nature (body, feeling, mind) and the higher Self (atma-buddhi-manas). The pairs of opposites reveal themselves especially forceful in this sign - the higher Self striving upwards, the form aspect drawing downwards. Five tests Hercules has to pass before the fruits of Wisdom become his own: Sincerity, Alertness, Persistence, the Unfolding of Power for the search, and - finally - the selfless loving Service for others.  In Gemini, we learn to recognize the presence of the Higher Self. In the beginning one is aware of voice but does not hear, one sees or has a premonition of some danger but is blind until all assumptions and beliefs are transformed into knowledge and experience. Prometheus stands for the escape from the bondage of the mind, Atlas symbolizes the freedom and readiness to carry \"the Weight of the World\". Both, Prometheus and Atlas are witnesses on the way to our awareness of the higher Self. Loving compassion born of right thinking will lead us towards the goal. The keynote signifies that the lower nature (body, feelings and mind) - symbolized in the lower pillar of the sign - has to fade and become submerged to the higher Self which will then grow and glow.Sources:urlLink ArtCharts urlLink http://www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Tidepool/4036/gemini.html urlLink The Labours of HerculesCurrent Phase: Balsamic in Sagittarius  Tuesday 12:07 AM PST Jupiter 23º Sagittarius (until Saturday) This is the Dark of the Moon: NO MAGICK IS TO BE DONE!!!

Anything can happen under the influence of this most romantic of Moons. Leo loves to be the center of attention, so get out there and shine! For those of you who made commitments to life changes on the New Moon in Aquarius, this is the time to put those plans into action. You get to begin your new life with the self-confidence of a Leo Full Moon opposing Uranus in Aquarius, which represents the radical energy to throw out the old and bring in the new. The Venus and Chiron conjunction in Capricorn will give you added strength to achieve your goals; no matter how hard and long it takes. Remember that on a Full Moon, it helps to release your old behavior through ritual. This is a Full Moon of great inspiration and should not be wasted. If you have been suffering with creative blocks, the Leo Full Moon bestows the energy to break free of inertia and get into action. If it doesn\\'t, you might reconsider your project or direction. Maybe it\\'s just not the right oneThis year the Leo Full Moon will be directly opposite Uranus in Aquarius. Some think that Aquarius and Leo are diametrically opposed to one another. But I find their synergistic and interdependent relationship unique among the signs. Aquarius demands radical change, which cannot be accomplished without Leo\\'s talents: unwavering self-belief in one\\'s personal vision and true leadership. Leo demands creativity and caring, which requires the Aquarian rejection of personal glorification in favor of global identification. When balanced, the Leo/Aquarius polarity works hand in hand to further the evolution of human civilization. Corruption, greed and suffering only exist when these energies lack equilibrium.  The Leo Full Moon assures us all that we have great personal power and we must learn to use it judiciously. This is the Full Moon to try on the role of leader. If you have wanted to come out front with your great ideas, this is the time to try. The connection with ego identity is strong on this Full Moon. Leo understands how much power it can wield, and will never shy away from using this knowledge to accomplish even the most outrageous goals. Forget the stereotypical Leo: a partygoer dancing with a lampshade on their head. Instead, think of showing up with a serious commitment to who you are and not backing down for anything. Leo is total self-belief and it uses total commitment to gain success and glory. Think of Madonna (Sun in Leo); she is a powerful presence who insists upon owning her vision and maintaining total control of the product. As we say in Silicon Valley, \"it\\'s all about believing your own marketing.\" Yes, of course there is a dark side to power and glory. We all know that an inflated ego creates the right conditions for abuses of power. But power used wisely can be of great benefit to all.The beauty of Leo is how much it truly cares about others, and since this is a Full Moon, let\\'s get into a celebratory space and bask in the light of Leo\\'s positive qualities. This is the most dramatic, elegant and fun Full Moon of the year. So get out and enjoy the fireworks!

The high road for this energy is that of the sacred warrior while the low road reminds us that when colored with fear, assertion can become aggression. This New Moon in Aries brings you golden opportunities to redefine and redirect the way you use this personally assertive energy. Here\\'s the cosmic context.  The Sun, Moon, and Mercury are partying in Aries, so blunt speech, as in speaking without thinking could make you the April Fool.  Use the quick-paced mental skills of Mercury\\'s presence in Aries to think before you speak and come up with positive loving scenarios and brilliant win-win solutions. Channel your energy into positive avenues that support your self-confidence.  Get ready for a shot of growth and optimism as Jupiter turns direct on April 3rd after a retrograde period that started on Dec. 4th.

This New Moon is a gift of enormous personal creative energy from the universe to use as you wish, so step forward boldly and courageously hand in hand and heart to heart with Spirit.

This holiday celebrates Maia, the mother  goddess, and coincides with the New Moon in the first earth sign of the  zodiac, Taurus.  Deepen your connection with the material world through  your senses, your body, your possessions, and Mother Nature herself.This is the first of two New Moons in May and the magic of new  beginnings, along with the pressure to take out the garbage, is seriously  amplified by the addition of two eclipses at the time of the Full Moon and  the 2nd New Moon.

Earthly  practicalities must be tended to and here are the cosmic currents urging you  on.  A grand fixed cross squarely provides the kick-off and guarantees a  change in the physical status quo. The first leg is occupied by the Sun (Spirit shining through the  material world of resources), the Moon (emotional need for material grounding  and security), Mercury retrograde (encouraging slow, patient,  penetrating review of your consciousness regarding personal and planetary  resources), and Ceres (Goddess of the Earth encouraging you to nurture  yourself by communing and creating with nature)\\x85 all in Taurus.  The next leg is occupied by Jupiter in Leo on one side  (inviting an  enlightened basis for security and wealth), Neptune in Aquarius on the  other (targeting areas of collective confusion and deception and shifting  perceptions concerning our humanitarian dreams), and the last leg held  up by Juno in Scorpio (bringing opportunities to break through to new  levels of abundance through equitable sharing of power and resources).This cosmic standoff can be used for great creativity and progress or  to produce deception and gluttony. Chiron, retrograde at 18 degrees  Capricorn, demands we know when less can be more, for the long-term good of  our personal and planetary health.  The challenge and gift of a Taurus Moon is unconditional self-love and  acceptance. Never underestimate the value of your greatest resource,  yourself in co-creatorship with Spirit. Getting clear about what and how  much you really need to thrive can help you eliminate excess stuff.  This helps you reclaim precious energy you\\'ll need so you\\'re able to take  advantage of the dynamic life-changing energies in store for you this  month.

This is the climax to a very cosmically complex month.  Remember the importance of breathing fully and deeply. May 30th, or 31st  depending n your time zone, is the 2nd brand new beginning gifted to us by  the month of May and the accompanying solar eclipse provides us with  the opportunity to move forward in new directions, provided we\\'ve allowed  ourselves to process the feelings stirred up by the Full Moon lunar  eclipse.  Imagination and magic are heightened at the time of this New Moon ( the  2nd New Moon in one month is called a Black Moon in the Wiccan  tradition and denotes a time when magic/alchemy is extremely powerful.) A  sextile to this New Moon from Jupiter in Leo (expansion and broader  horizons) and Neptune in Aquarius (our field of dreams) sends a message telling  us that we can create what we can imagine.  Don\\'t put too much on your  plate or you\\'ll lose your focus and sacrifice much-needed clarity.  This eclipse may well pop information concerning the shady dealings of  Congress and the FCC concerning private and corporate media interests  in radio and television broadcasting. Freedom of speech and  communication is a basic tenet upon which this country was built, so stay aware of  what\\'s happening and make those calls and write those letters. The  shift from Taurus (ruler of the throat) to Gemini within the month of May  reminds you to let your voice be heard.On June 3rd, Saturn vacates Gemini after a 3-year stay and begins a  journey through Cancer that will last until July 16, 2005. Woman\\'s issues  will be more prominent and the political, economic, and personal  lessons of the last 30 years come up for a reality check. (The first woman\\'s  bank, the first woman to climb Mt. Everest, the first woman priests  ordained in the Anglican and Episcopalian churches, as well as Watergate,  worldwide inflation and the oil embargo/energy crisis marked the last  transit of Saturn through Cancer.)Venus (ruler of Taurus, love, beauty and the way we attract what we  need on the material plane) and Mercury (the way we think and assimilate  information) are united in Taurus reminding us to connect heart and mind  to find win-win solutions. Stay positive, keep an open mind, cultivate  a willingness to listen, and tune into the adventurous excitement of  the new world that\\'s opening up.

This preparatory stage in the process of our development gives us time to improve our situation by attending to details. The simple rituals of daily life will provide the grounding necessary for balance. This is an especially good period to work on the mind-body connection.Analyze and adjust daily routines to support physical and mental well being. Good health, altruistic service and productive employment support success; practicality and prudence guarantee it. Use this cycle to  refine  and  revise  the spark of intention you ignited last spring. It\\'s time to redesign the form the future will take.Mercury is Retrograde  from (Aug 28-Sept 20). Retrograde means redo, rethink, rewrite, revaluate, revisit, and reanalyze. Over the next three weeks we will have the opportunity to see what needs changing in work, health, finances, and life. Mercury loves to play hide-and-go-seek with every area of communication including, travel, cars, (traffic jams), computers, break downs, and lost items.  This creates an environment of whacky, crazy-making events and mishaps. Timing is everything! If you can wait, do not sign anything until after September 20th, your patience will pay off.Mercury is the Messenger to the gods (archetypes).  He travels freely between worlds your conscious mind (the part of you reading this right now), and the subconscious (that which is just below the threshold of your awareness) i.e., dreams, true desires, wishes. And, the unconscious mind, the unknown part of Self made conscious through others, by mirroring back to us what is deeply hidden both light, and dark. All of life is energy.  I am energy. You are energy. The personal and planetary astrology represents the energy patterns in motion we are currently utilizing (working with) consciously or unconsciously.  We live cycles within cycles.  With the Moon in Virgo and Jupiter the planet of wealth, blessings, gifts from the gods, and expansion, moving into Virgo also, where Jupiter will stay for the next year, we are invited to heal our health and advance our careers. Watch for making mountains(Jupiter) out of molehills (Virgo). We are building towards the fullmoon.  Plant your seeds (New Moon) and prepare for the harvest (Full Moon).In this cycle of Virgo perfection, why not practice being  \"unconditionally constructive\"  that is no self-criticism or criticism of others, continuously focus on the positive, if we send out positive energy we will get back positive results, this is the Law of Attraction.  What is working in your life?  Instead of getting caught up in the negatives and fueling frustration, why not  express gratitude  for your blessings and practice the Law of Allowing.Explore this Virgo cycle deeply and the secrets of financial/personal success.  Money is not the root of all-evil.  It is what we do with it!  We must evolve beyond the fear of money, sense of limitation, and struggle.  The power (global) elite are crumbling!  We the people are winning. As bad as things may seem, events are minuscule compared to what was seen (prophesized). We are moving into the light (energy) of the fifth dimension, a vibration of love, compassion and abundance.Monthly Affirmation:  I serve the highest good through Love. I filter information without judgment. I find perfection in the moment.  Interpretation by  urlLink Zodiac Arts  and  urlLink Kelley RosanoLEO LUNAR CYCLE  July 28 - August 26 Interpretation by Maya del Mar from  urlLink http://www.daykeeperjournal.comLeo is about expressing our selfhood, our personal centers, the heart of ourselves, that natural order within us which comes from spirit, and the expression of which gives our lives joy and drama and meaning. Leo is about integrity, nobility, honor, generosity, being true to the unfolding of ourselves and sharing that unfolding freely. In Cancer we created our personal, safe spot, our home port, our power place. Now in Leo we can grow in the garden which we\\x92ve created, and blossom there for all the world to see. Leo is associated with flower gardens, which capture the sun not for utility but for beauty\\x92s sake, simply to show off the splendors of life. On joyous and ceremonial occasions we give flowers, a symbol of sharing the divine love which we feel in our hearts.Leo is a time when we have the power to bring new life energy from our deepest humanitarian resources into expression in our character and daily activities. Think of the Sun, endlessly radiating heat and light to the solar system. Now we can incorporate that great energy into our own centers. Leo leads to growth in our creative talents by strengthening both mind and will. Abstract thought is stimulated, as is power, confidence, and enthusiasm. Our receptivity to subtle forces and the powers of the imagination are also increased.Self-mastery can take a giant leap during Leo time, leading to a new appreciation of our capabilities and an enhanced feeling of identity. Leo is also inspirational. Vacationing, traveling, enjoying and celebrating the beauties of creation are Leonian. The greatest expression of Leo is love\\x97the divine force which nurtures that which it has created. So now, during Leo time, let the love flow\\x97love of nature, love of ourselves, love of our fellow humans, and love of the omnipresent divine spark.  Bill Clinton is a very Leo type. Notice his lion\\x92s mane, his commanding presence, and the magnetic radiance which beams from him. He has created his own life and forged his own destiny with a strong sense of purpose, and in the process has inspired people around him, all Leo qualities. Carl Jung, with sun in Leo, broke from Freud and viewed the psyche as an evolving, growing center from which, like a mandala, life patterns radiate\\x97an expression of the sun within ourselves. Rosalynn Carter and Jacqueline Onassis are examples of Leo First Ladies. They both illustrate the natural dignity of Leo. Pride and arrogance can be Leo pitfalls.\"  urlLink SCORPIO LUNAR CYCLE  by Crystal Pomeroy Oct. 25 - Nov. 22 This Scorpio New Moon begins the lunar cycle marked by Samhain, Halloween (originally, Hallow\\x92s Mass), El Día de los Muertos, and All Souls\\' Day\\x97the classic Scorpio festivities around the world. Prayerful reflection sets this lunation and the intense energies it entails off to a high-vibration start. It also gives us a chance to move into the year\\x92s end from a most constructive mental and spiritual position, especially with the very strong Saturn influences.  According to ancient pagan and neo-pagan tradition, the days preceding and marking mid-autumn are the high point of the year, a time at which many of life\\x92s most powerful aspects were traditionally celebrated. The current lunar cycle is most apt for resurrecting their energies, in a post-pagan world which tends to deny and repress the vital themes associated with the end of harvest, such as: change, death, Earth as our mother, the love that we feel towards her and towards those who have departed from the physical plane, and our individual power to  tap into transpersonal forces .  According to the ancient custom, the harvest-end festivities serve to thank the earth for her bounties, to thank Spirit, and to share both thanks and fruits with all loved ones, including those who have moved on from the material plane, honoring them personally in the realm of invisible life they now inhabit.  From these days forth, no fruit could be harvested until the following year, to give the earth a rest. On special, colorful altars or tables, places were set and food prepared and served for departed loved ones (and to this day, still are by Wikkans and Central Americans of native descent). At its heyday, this multi-dimensional, highly emotive holiday was a collective expression which underscored and fortified divine human nature, that higher potential whose scope is larger than mere consumption, physical survival and material appearances, capable of honoring and venerating all beings, including those (Mother Earth, disincarnate souls and other subtle entities) whose messages are audible to the spiritual (vs. merely physical) ear.  The race memory of this tradition, as well as the energies of the sky and earth themselves at this time, make of the Samhain New Moon a truly miraculous portal which anyone can access to  multiply blessings in all areas of personal and global existence , with prayers like the following, which can be included in a Samhain gathering or done privately, and which are adapted to current cultural terms and understanding:  strengthening tolerance at its deepest level, sending light to our departed loved ones, and invoking the amazing power of endings so available at this time, to annul whatever circumstances seem to have delayed successful consolidation of the passing year\\x92s goals . Stay tuned to our meditation for the Full Moon within this same cycle, designed to fill out our autumnal acts of inner power with visualizations which activate our mystical, feminine (in both men and women) power of attraction to magnetize whatever we need to finish our year\\x92s work, as we will also share a magical Full Moon offering to heal Mother Earth.  Before the actual altar and prayer suggestions, let\\x92s reflect on what this particular Samhain New Moon has to do with tolerance. In the first place, Wikkans especially focus on that virtue at this time, as they pay homage their predecessors who were burned at the stake by European churches. Furthermore, the intense Saturn stationary-retrograde which takes place right with this New Moon gives us a chance to effectively remake how we exercise our moral, and, as it is in Cancer, emotional, judgment nature. Metaphysically speaking, we have a chance to soften the punishing patriarch within,  informing our judgment nature with love , staying the mental hand that would condemn without previous, compassionate reflection.  Tolerance is a personal and global necessity. As remotely savage as the witch-burnings may seem, the danger of such extreme, thoughtless outbursts will lurk ever beneath the surface of our daily normalcy until we include careful, open-minded consideration, both compassionate and rational, in our a way of thought and life. Politically, such an approach can protect us from mass manipulation into rash, fundamentalist support of scapegoating, such as evidenced in Nazi Germany, the McCarthy witch-hunts, modern day treatment of Muslims, and the recent special elections in California.  The following principle is inscribed on the emerald tablet, \"As above, so below.\" If you are still reading this by now, chances are you\\x92re among those who consider ourselves relatively tolerant. In such cases, prayer is a strong ally to pass from philosophic lenience to the ability to release emotional condemnation of those whose value systems diverge, even widely, from our own. Moral tolerance does not necessarily imply putting up with unacceptable conditions, but rather  staying free from the judgment trap , of sentencing those that differ from our most cherished tenets. Prayer for this intent can release us to the Power of Higher Love, which in turn will touch our personal realms, eventually influencing the larger communities of city, state, country and globe, lifting all levels up into a magical sphere of protection for the planet, for Spirit, for ourselves and for every visible and invisible being. This dimension of inner abundance will survive even when our outer forms, like the harvest\\x92s last fruits, are released unto Mother Earth.  Call on the Power of Endings to usher in a happy close to your passing year!  1) Make a list of those goals for work and other applied efforts you can remember having at the beginning of 2003.  2) On another page, briefly describe those activities, situations, behaviors, beliefs or attachments which you feel have kept you from consolidating those goals.  3) Call on the Angel of Endings, and ask her to assist you in accepting the demise of whatever situations would delay the consolidation of your divine plan for 2003. Then declare aloud, 13 times, as you visualize their meaning:  I CALL ON THE POWER OF ENDINGS WHICH IS NOW RENEWING THE EARTH, TO ELIMINATE ALL THAT WOULD DELAY THE CONSOLIDATION OF MY HIGHEST WORK. JUST AS LEAVES NOW FALL AWAY AND ARE DISSOLVED INTO THE EARTH, THOSE SITUATONS, ACTIVITIES, BELIEFS AND BEHAVIORS THAT NEED TO, NOW DROP FROM THE PANORAMA OF MY LIFE SO THAT MY HIGHEST ENDEAVORS MAY CONSOLIDATE AND PROSPER, QUICKLY AND IN PEACE.urlLink LIBRA LUNAR CYCLESept. 25 - Oct. 24, 2003 Fall is officially here and the waning half of the yearly lunar cycle begins!

If we have been too serious and focused on work, perhaps we need to invite play back into our lives.  Aquarian energy fires lightning truth, unexpected events, and upsets into the status quo to keep life from getting too rigid, constricting, or comfortable.Shaking and waking us up to experience new ways of living, being and loving.Aquarius invites us into fresh starts, new roads, boldness, genius, and group membership.  Wild man Uranus is the ruling planet of Aquarius, he is outrageous, shocking, and erratic.  Uranus loves to create chaos, and upset for that which is out dated, out grown or boorishly stuck.  We will continue to experience a breakdown in paradigms, institutions, and organizations that are in truth obsolete.  The light is oncoming and the Age of Aquarius is dawning.  Uranus is in the spiritual sign Pisces for the next eight years, erasing boundaries between the spiritual and physical worlds, technology will boom with space age inventions.  Your intuitve and psychic abilities will continue to grow.  Pay attention to your dreams they are filled with life directing knowledge. Where do you need more freedom?  On a planetary level, we are closing out the Piscean Age, and ending a 26,000-year cycle.  We are now entering the Age of Aquarius and starting a new 26,000 year cycle. In truth, we live cycles within cycles, Pisces (last two thousand years) into Aquarius (next two thousand years.) The Age of Aquarius is the promised coming revolution in higher consciousness, an age of peace, truth, beauty, freedom, and love. Where competition is replaced with cooperation.Today is the time to prepare for higher consciousness by practicing Self-love and acceptance.  The paramount mission, individually, may be for the development of a healthy foundation with Self and Spirit. \\'Self\\' is the inner essence, soul identity and authenticity of each individual.  When we are in alignment with Self, we base our choices upon one\\'s true values and personal integrity, and enjoy a certain level of completion, joy, flow, and wholeness.

We are the seedlings of the Aquarian Age, the forerunners plowing the way for greater souls of light to embody with us and take us to Greatest Party we have experienced in thousands of years, the Golden Age of Aquarius.  urlLink Pisces Lunar Cycle  by Ronni Lynn Feb 20 - March 20  This month the New Moon will be in the sign of Pisces. Pisces is a most mystical sign because it deals with the unconscious side of life and ourselves.  Pisces\\' influence dissolves boundaries- those barriers that separate people and even nations from understanding each other.  When boundaries are lifted we experience compassion, true understanding and a gentleness toward ourselves and each other. In order to accomplish this we must first deal with dissolving those boundaries within ourselves. By this I mean the differences between our external selves (how we act, dress, what we say we believe, etc) with our internal selves- who we truly are. When we are free to reflect to the outside who we really are then we will experience increased authenticity. With this authenticity we will begin to experience true connections with others. After all, if we are being a true reflection of ourselves, it will be our truth that others will be responding to. What a wonderful foundation for any relationship! When people who are being true to themselves interact, when their internal, and/or subconscious self is reflected outwardly, barriers between them will melt because they will have an understanding of each other. We all have much more in common than we realise or would like to admit. With this in mind, this is a good time to forgive others who have wronged us, ask forgiveness, or to forgive ourselves for past failures.A good way to find your inner truth is to quiet your mind, to meditate and just observe what comes up. Sometimes defense mechanisms that may have served us at the time of a traumatic experience persist and only serve to block our true energies from arising. You can sometimes tell that this is happening when you no longer allow yourself to feel vulnerable emotionally with others. This is a time when as we relax our minds and bodies we learn to release those tensions that block our emotional response with others. Pisces rules higher ideals, dreams and inspirations.  Let your imagination and creativity expand during this time.  We can wish to increase our spiritual awareness, our surrender to and faith in a higher power, or to find the correct spiritual path or teacher. At this time perhaps we can come to a realization that everything has a purpose, we are all connected, and that there is a perfect order to the universe. We are all part of the unfolding of that universe. This is a good month to wish for a decrease in feeling like a victim, or in feeling helpless or out of control. These are Pisces qualities that can go overboard. We need to  curb a tendency for complete escapism , such as overuse of alcohal or drug abuse. While fantasy and inspiration can work to help us develop into more evolved beings, to expand our possibilities, we can also  learn to distinguish fantasy from reality, truth from fiction . We must avoid the tendency to deceive ourselves and others with escapism. Pisces energy helps us dream, and offers us the opportunity to use that dream to make the world a better place for everyone. Neptune\\'s energy can be harnessed to increase our creativity and creative expression in art, writing, dance, drama, or music.  Dreams and inspiration are the first steps before action. The next sign, Aries will take the actions that follow the dreams that Pisces created. Pisces is the last sign of the Zodiac and with the dreams of Pisces feeding unconsciously into the energies of the first sign of the Zodiac, Aries, the cycle is again complete. The next new moon will be in Aries on March 20, 2004 at 5:42 PM. E.S.T.

The equinox occurs just hours before the New Moon. This emphasizes the cycle\\'s underlying theme of  balance  and brings us into the First Quarter of the lunar year... a major turning point. Daylight savings time occurs on April 4th further underscoring the shift towards  more and more light .Last month you grounded yourself by strengthening your spiritual connection, getting in touch with your dreams and reaching for a higher love. Remember to utilize the warrior energy of Aries in a most sacred way as you  take action to manifest those qualities and dreams .A 3-week Mercury Retrograde period begins on April 6th bringing you an opportunity to take care of unfinished business as you prepare to move full tilt boogie in new directions. The combination of planetary energies reminds you to  temper your ideas with patience, persistence and prudence  as you pursue lasting goals and values. Don\\'t energize negativity, but  hone your intent and harness your will  in the most positive ways as you blast off into the fresh start of a most promising spring.urlLink TAURUS LUNAR CYCLE  by Dana Gerhardt @  urlLink http://www.mooncircles.comApril 19 - May 20  This New Moon brings a partial Solar Eclipse. Eclipses bring a dramatic acceleration or sudden turn of events. What has recently changed for you? Eclipses force much needed changes to the surface. Their shakedown makes it easier to release worn-out behaviors, attitudes and relationships. Their  turbulence impels us to grow . This New Moon is particularly potent. It is the second New Moon in Aries this year. Was\\x97at the Aries New Moon last month\\x97your inner heroic nature roused to action? You may have found that what was stagnant in your life was becoming unbearable. Spring is about initiating action. Leaves suddenly fill out bare branches. Hyacinth and tulip bulbs shoot up from the ground.  Where have you been springing forth?  This is the second cycle of Artemis\\x97goddess of the Moon and goddess of the hunt. She is summoned in each of us this season, expressed in our joyous independence, in our nurturing and courageous action.Perhaps the most important resolve you might make this New Moon is to shift your focus from what you don\\x92t want\\x97on to what you do.  Your future will be created by what you place your mind on now.  If you\\x92re focused on irritations or lack, you will get more of the same. If you fill your heart with winning feelings, if you  fill your mind with images of success , the momentum towards a brighter future will build. Negative energy only brings more negativity. The tulip bulb shooting up from the earth doesn\\x92t think \"I don\\x92t want more winter.\" It is thinking \"I want to be a luscious bloom.\" When you do likewise this cycle, a resplendent future will be speeding your way. urlLink GEMINI LUNAR CYCLE : By Rev. Pauline Southard  This month\\'s lunar cycle has an overall scattered feeling especially after May 21, 2004 when the Sun leaves Taurus for light and mutable Gemini. We feel we are jumping from one thing to another. Taking even just a few minutes to regroup will truly help this month. The New Moon of May 19, 2004 arrives at 12:51 AM EDT. This is the last gasp of the very fixed Taurus energy we experienced during the last lunar cycle. This New Moon lies at the very bottom of the chart, beckoning us to plant our spring gardens and attend to matters around the house. We could really use a little time out from work. A household crisis requires that we scramble to manipulate our schedules.  Our committed love relationships are smooth sailing now. Sexual intimacy provides us with a wonderful nurturing connection that lasts long after the physical act is completed. Truly a meeting of souls.This part of the lunar cycle provides us with great potential to plan our summer vacations and those of the children we are responsible for. A sibling conveys some good advice concerning matters of the heart and/or financial affairs.The First Quarter Moon of May 27, 2004 at 3:56 AM EDT starts its work while we are still dreaming. The Sun has now entered Gemini. Gemini energy in its pure form is all about communication, inquisitiveness and love of socializing. At its best, its clever wit can cause us to look at matters from a different perspective while laughing. When this energy is used negatively, it can denote lack of focus, the facile  easy answer over the deeper and more thoughtful approach and a disregard for other\\x92s feelings.Expect some unexpected expenses that may impede our goals in the short term. However, towards the end of the First Quarter Moon, we find that our partners are particularly helpful in very practical and substantial ways.  The Full Moon of June 3, 2004 at 12:19 AM EDT makes everything appear larger than life as the Sun and Moon depart from a square to Jupiter. Relax! Although we feel that we must do it all perfectly, perhaps an adequate job will suffice without totally stressing us out. Any recent tensions in our relationships ease now. It could be fun to see a play or an unusual foreign movie now.  The Third Quarter Moon of June 9, 2004 at 4:02 PM EDT heightens our emotional sensitivity. We are particularly adept at tuning into our lover\\x92s and children\\x92s feelings. A great time to go to the beach and paint! Or we could single mindedly pursue projects that have seemed to have had a missing element until now and complete them. It is a great week for a trip with a lover- either an inner or literal journey would be wonderful now.Lunar Energy: Full Moon RitualsThe moon has always played an important part in ancient spiritual practices. Since the beginning of time, people have recognized lunar power, which is where the term, \"lunacy\" comes from. Even today there is much speculation as to the affects of the moon\\'s phases, particularly the full moon, on our moods and behavior. The belief behind full moon rituals is to harness lunar power to the benefit of oneself and others. Ceremonies performed at this phase of the moon are meant for empowerment, as well to manifest positive changes.The full moon appears once every 29.53 days, therefore rituals can be performed almost every month, sometimes even twice a month. And, you need not be outside or even see the full moon to reap its powerful benefits. There are many full moon rituals, some more complex than others, involving magical tools and enhancements. Yet, many are quite simple, including a moon bask which is just that, basking in the full moonlight and meditating. You can do the ritual standing, sitting, or laying on the ground, or even indoors if it\\'s more practical. Just stand by a large window, open if possible, and meditate on that which would enhance your life.One well-known ceremony is \"Drawing Down the Moon,\" to connect with the power and wisdom of the full moon. In Wicca traditions, a priestess performs the ceremony in order for her to become the living embodiment of the mood goddess. There are also rituals where all participants \"draw down the moon\" to evoke the deity of the moon within themselves. For a healing ritual, Selena Fox, of the Circle Craft tradition, offers this Moon Mirror Healing. Place a silvered mirror face up on an altar or sacred place so that the light of the full moon shines upon it. Place a symbol to represent the one seeking healing in the center of the mirror. The symbol may be a photo, piece of jewelry, lock of hair, or simply a name on a card. Use the symbol on the mirror in the moonlight as a focal point as you imagine that the one needing healing is becoming well and then healthy. After the ritual, deliver the symbol to the subject of the healing rite as an additional way of transmitting healing. Cleanse the mirror you used by washing it with a mugwort solution or passing it through the smoke from mugwort or another incense. In this way, the mirror will be ready for use for another healing.Whether you perform simple or elaborate full moon rituals, or just enjoy the beauty of the full moon, you\\'re participating in a long tradition of showing appreciation for a powerful source of illumination.

From: KnowledgeNews  info@knowledgenews.net >  Prepare to be mooned--blue mooned.  This Saturday, July 31, a \"blue moon\" rises.  Of course, you probably won\\'t see even a hint of blue color, just your average full moon. So what gives? What\\'s so blue about a moon that isn\\'t? Heck, astronomers even say that blue moons aren\\'t rare. And folklorists say they\\'re not what everyone thinks they are.  As any budding astronomer can tell you, a \"blue moon\" is the second full moon in a calendar month. It isn\\'t really blue. It\\'s just a name. But why, of all things, do we call a white moon \"blue\" Actually, there are truly blue moons.In 1883, an Indonesian volcano erupted with the force of a 100-megaton nuclear bomb. With a roar heard nearly 400 miles (over 600 kilometers) away, Mount Krakatoa belched a column of volcanic gas and ash into the atmosphere. That night, the moon rose blue over Indonesia. Particles from Krakatoa\\'s ash, not more than a micron wide, made it happen. These micron-wide particles were exactly the right size to scatter red light, while allowing other colors, such as blue, to pass. The result: a blue sphere hanging in the sky. Different sized particles filtered other colors and caused different effects. In fact, for several years after the eruption, there were reports fro mall over the globe of red moons, green moons, and, yes, even more blue moons..What\\'s more, some of the sunsets following the eruption were such a blazing red that people actually called on firemen to drown the optical illusion.. The eruptions of Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo produced the same anomaly. So have forest fires.Still, none of this explains why we call the second full moon in a month a blue moon. The phrase is old, even if the modern meaning is not. Before Shakespeare penned a word of Hamlet, the English knew little couplets like: If they say the moon is blewe, we must believe that it is true.urlLink Current Gibbous Moon Phase, a self-help Lunar Astrology guide : \"The symbolic new moon seed now buds!

The vulnerability of this state increases our need for security, and we find ourselves attending to those aspects of our lives which center in our own hearth\\x97our inner child, our family, our domestic lives, our homes, our businesses\\x97those things which relate to creating a stable base, those situations in which we find  safety and comfort .The Sun enters the sign of Cancer at Summer Solstice. This is the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere. At that moment the days begin to shorten, the night force takes over, and we begin our six-month journey of gradually embracing the darkness, which climaxes at winter solstice on December 21.Like the night to which she introduces us,  the forces of Cancer are mysterious . They are ruled by the Moon, the Goddess of the Night, who brings her waxing and waning lanterns to guide us through the dark, through the murky unconscious, through the watery depths of feeling.In Gemini we made connections with every passing event, as we restlessly kept ourselves in motion, learning about the world, exploring. Now in Cancer it is time to center ourselves, to  turn within  and learn who we are and what we need, to nurture our inner child and create a safe home for it. The darkness of the subconscious is our real staging ground for life, and we must develop lines of support to anchor ourselves to its vastness, while at the same time maintaining fluid passageways for growth, for change, and for movement to new levels.In Aries, we brought the seed of spirit to earth, in Taurus we multiplied the seeds, in Gemini the air swept them up to disperse them, and now in Cancer each seed will  find its proper spot in which to put down strong roots .It is most appropriate that we plant our gardens by the moon, which rules Cancer. The moon fluctuates within its monthly cycle, and also is connected with the daily fluctuations of tidal waters throughout the world. Underlying this fluctuation, which may seem capricious if we don\\x92t pay attention to life\\x92s rhythms, there are regular cycles and predictability. The energy of Cancer, similarly, is a fluctuating movement\\x97going within to deep sources and then moving out to express those depths in the world, ever shifting as do the ocean currents. But like the moon Cancer has its inner predictability, and is accountable to its own rhythms.Cancer rules containers of all kinds, including the womb, where young life is nourished, and the home, where families are nourished. It rules gestation, that vulnerable time when an embryo is being formed deep within layers of protection.Cancer is associated with bodies of fluid, such as lakes and amniotic sacs. It knows. It knows that water, which symbolizes emotions in astrology, is the essential matrix of life, and that feelings are tender and vulnerable and must be protected, just as the growing fetus must be protected. It knows intimately about growth, because it carries the growth process within itself. And growth, too, must be protected and attended to so that the fledgling is strong and healthy.  The Sabian Symbol for 26 Cancer is:\"GUESTS ARE READING IN THE LIBRARY OF A LUXURIOUS HOME. The transference of social privilege to the level of intellectual enjoyment. We see the concretization of cultural excellence and wealth at the level at which individuals can exercise their developmental capacities in comfort. The process is individualized because the library belongs to a private residence, the luxury of which implies an individual\\x92s concentration upon the acquisition of wealth. Maintaining CLASS STANDARDS OF INFORMATION. What is at stake here is the need to conform to the requirements of one\\x92s social status.\"The Dining Room  Dining tables should not be placed in front of the main door.  A dining table that faces the toilet receives too much Yin and can negatively affect health.  A dining table should not be used as partition between two rooms.  If a dining table faces the kitchen or is in the kitchen area, it receives too much Yang and the diners might develop a bad temperament.

Paint a single wall in a soft sage or a warm wine. This adds a welcome touch of color and warmth.Get smart about storage. Carefully plan every piece of furniture to control clutter. Open shelving is also a good option, because it keeps the wall exposed and maintains the open feeling of the room. Use lighting as art.  Simple, modern wall sconces are attractive and provide soft illumination without using up valuable surface space. Use area rugs as anchors. Area rugs help break down a loft space into separate living areas, without sacrificing overall openness. They also warm up bare floors and help reduce echoes.Maintain open space. Arrange furniture so it does not block views to windows and doors. Modern benches, stools, and ottomans are great because their simple, clean lines don\\'t obstruct views and minimize the feel of a small room.

Ladders or step stools topped with shelves or a flush door table top provide storage space, display area, desk or work surface.  Adding legs and cushions to a door or other flat board makes a bench, bed or sofa. Casters may also be used in place of legs. Without the cushions, you have a movable plant stand to display collections, books or records.  Bricks (stone, concrete or glass) and boards can be used for bookshelves, shoe shelves, end tables, coffee tables and plant stands.  Use five-sided cubes for a number of things. A basic 15-inch cube made of plywood can be a coffee table, an end table, a storage unit, a cushioned seat or almost anything you like, and in any color because it is easy to paint or enamel. Brightly painted cubes lined up along the floor of a child\\'s room will hold books and toys. Stack them up in your family room to hold books, small TV, stereo equipment, and decorative objects. Stacked units can be used for a two-faced room divider with open sides facing either way.  Storage containers can be made from boxes, tin cans, baskets or other recycled containers. These can be painted, covered with self-adhesive paper, wallpaper, fabric. Sturdy old tables, chests or storage units can look attractive through refinishing, painting, application of self-adhesive paper or upholstering with easily-cared-for fabric.New or used filing cabinets may be used in a variety of ways to provide an abundance of storage.

As Barney Capehart says; \\'If everyone went to the store today and bought high efficiency products or devices for their homes, offices, and factories, Florida could cut its energy use in half.\\'  Daylighting through skylights and windows can be economical. Only indirect light generates less heat than electric lamps. Skylights can be modified with white paint, lenses, or reflective film to reduce solar heat gain.  Incandescent lamps are the most widely used, and the least efficient. Low pressure sodium vapor lamps, one of the most efficient light sources, uses 9 times less electricity for the same brightness, produce less heat, and lasts 18 times as long as incandescent lamps. Sodium lamp light, however, does not render color naturally. urlLink Clothes Dryers :  The most efficient method of drying clothes is to employ the solar powered clothes dryer; that is, a line strung up between two posts or trees. When dried in the sun, clothes smell fresher and look cleaner. If a mechanical clothes dryer is selected, pay attention to the yellow efficiency labels.  In general, appliances using heat such as water heaters, space heaters, clothes dryers and cooking appliances are more efficient if they use natural gas rather than electricity or liquid petroleum gas. Natural gas normally provides: a wider variety of temperature settings, instantaneous on/off heat, is more environmentally benign, and is more economical - the energy cost is usually half the cost of electricity. urlLink Washing Machines : Washing machines should have at least three water level selections - high, medium and low; and provide for washing in cold, warm and hot water and rinsing in cold water. Other features should be selected on the type of washing that is expected. Some of these include delicate and permanent press cycles. In general, washing in warm water is the most energy efficient method; cold water washing usually requires a longer cycle or more detergent to wash the clothes to the same degree of cleanliness. Using the proper water level to fit the load is probably the most important energy saving consideration when operating a washing machine.\"  Clearance Items  Globalization starts with getting the details right.

Instead, they draw on emotional reactions, particularly for certain kinds of moral dilemmas.  The results also show how tools of neuroscience are beginning to reveal the biological underpinnings of the subtlest elements of human behavior, said Joshua Greene, a graduate student in philosophy who conducted the study in collaboration with scientists in the psychology department and the Center for the Study of Brain, Mind and Behavior.  \"We think of moral judgments as so ethereal,\" said Greene. \"Now we\\'re in a position to start looking at brain anatomy and understanding how neural mechanisms produce patterns in our behavior.\"  The study focused on a classic set of problems that have fascinated moral philosophers for years because of the difficulty in identifying moral principles that agree with the way people react.

Non-coincidental events do not register in our memories with nearly the same intensity. Second, we fail to realize the extent to which highly improbable events occur daily to everyone. It is not possible to estimate all the probabilities of many paired events that occur in our daily lives. We often tend to assign coincidences a lesser probability than they deserve.However, it is possible to calculate the probabilities of some seemingly improbable events with precision.

Universal Forum of Cultures 2004 Bees invade the internetBy BBC News Online internet reporter Mark Ward  Soon software that acts like bees or ants could be running the internet.Researchers at the University of California are claiming that we need radically new ways to run the net as more and more people and devices go online.Michael Wang and Tatsuya Suda say that existing methods of keeping the net going will not be able to cope when billions of people, mobile phones, hand-held computers and household appliances are routinely using it to communicate.What is needed, claim the pair, are self-organising systems inspired by biology.The researchers are experimenting with discrete programs called agents that have been modelled on bees and ants.Individually these insects are very stupid but put enough of them together and they do a very efficient job of running and maintaining huge structures like nests and hives without any central control.By contrast, current internet management systems tend to be very centralised and directed by people.Mr Wang says that this set-up will be unable to cope when everything from our PCs to refrigerators is online.No-one will have the time or inclination to ensure that all the devices are doing what they should, he says.\"The devices should just self-manage or self-organise and just do the right things,\" says Mr Wang.Many popular web events already struggle to serve all the people that want to see them.When Sir Paul McCartney did a webcast of a performance at the Cavern in Liverpool, servers were overwhelmed by the numbers wanting to watch the show.Under the scheme proposed by the US researchers, as a website increases in popularity the content on it, be it a video or audio stream, will be copied and ferried to websites closer to the people trying to see or hear it.Mr Wang says that the user requests are like food and the small software programs that ferry the content across are like bees blazing a trail to the source. The bees \"die\" when users stop requesting clips.Belgian scientist Marco Dorigo is looking at using small, stupid, ant-like programs to improve the running of the internet. But he is proposing to let the ants run the infrastructure of the net rather than just serve up video clips to people.The bee-like software entities are programmed with a few simple rules that define what they do.This rule-based approach is also being used to recreate huge battle scenes for the Lord of the Rings movie currently being filmed in New Zealand.The troops in the battle scenes are computer-generated orcs, elves, humans and dwarves that have been programmed with a few rules that define their fighting style, who their enemies are and what to do when a foe has been killed.Battle commences when the troops are unleashed on each other and computer cameras record the flow of action.Iceland launches energy revolution  By environment correspondent Tim Hirsch  In 1874 the science fiction writer Jules Verne envisaged a world in which water would replace coal as the fuel of the future.Now the Icelanders believe they can turn that dream into reality within a generation - and they are taking the first steps next year in their project to create the world\\'s first hydrogen society.Iceland has already gone further than any other country in exploiting its abundant sources of renewable energy.

I\\'d like to take a closer look at these labels.Consider how many useful and pragmatic people read therapy and self-help books because they\\'re want to fulfil their potential as balanced, self-aware individuals. Many of these books talk about the notion of nurturing one\\'s \\'inner child.\\' The inner child is that part of us that feels enthusiasm and joy most strongly, and which responds most truthfully to the world. Well and good; evidently the \"inner child\" is regarded as good and precious. But what can we say about the inner adolescent? Why aren\\'t we nurturing the inner adolescent?I think you can hardly say the phrase \\'teenager\\' these days without immediately thinking of somebody rebellious and confused, or remembering one\\'s own years of irritable awkwardness. We haven\\'t got a lot good to say about teenagers, and yet we should. The author Philip Pullman wrote something very interesting in response to a question about why he preferred to write for and about teenagers.At that age, he said, children are becoming aware of the world in a new way, and they have time to ask the big questions: What is the meaning of life, why are we here, what is our purpose? Later on we get busy, we get cynical, and we are in danger of forgetting we ever cared.I\\'d agree with that. I\\'d go further and say that for many teenagers, those years are a time of great stress partly because it is an age of idealism and yet they are just beginning to learn about the world\\'s tired habits - its petty hypocrisies, callous persecutions, deadly evasions of responsibility, casual negligence towards justice, and the ignoble worms of greed that gnaw away at the heart of every great enterprise... Teenagers rage against the wrongness of the world because they see it more freshly and it wounds them more keenly. As one becomes older, wiser, and tireder, it seems less hassle to take the easy course, to act circumspectly, to be politic more often than honest. I think teenagers rage against growing into that state, and the best of them still believe that they will change the world by virtue of naming and confronting its evils.I\\'d like to throw in one of the ultimate Romantic poems I\\'ve ever come across. It\\'s by an Argentinean poet, and to me it sums up that idealism of adolescence which rejects the deceitful world with one grand gesture:For Afterwards  I would like to die when the day is ending on the open sea and looking at the sky; where the agony of death may seem but sleep and the soul may seem a bird which mounts in flight.  And in the final instants I would hear, already with the sky and sea alone, no other sobbing prayers or sobbing voices than those of waves in their majestic fall.  To die when life is sadly hauling back  its golden nets from out the tide\\'s deep green and be like yonder sun that dies down slowly: some very shining thing that\\'s lost from sight.  To die, and young, before unfaithful time destroys the delicate and gentle crown; whilst life still tells us: I am yours although we know so well it will betray us.  Manuel Gutierrez (1859 - 1895) (Translation: Gordon Challis)  Yes, a modern person might find this sentimental and grandiose. It is utterly fantastical in its all-or-nothing approach to life. It offers no gritty pragmatic solutions to the problem of living in a less-than-perfect world. It may be adolescent in its grand gesture of utterly rejecting the world in all its complex awfulness. But would the world be a richer place if everything as great, beautiful and futile as this poem, were banished from our consciousness? I could not bear the loss.For this is the inner teenager that Tolkien and many other fantasy books appeal to. They are books that are about honour and justice and the recognition of absolute good and evil; they are books about daring and courage and ultimate sacrifices and grand gestures against hopeless odds.Nobody has lost that inner teenager who has flung aside their life and decided to change a political system or overturn a scientific belief; or who has shrugged off convention in order to embark on a great love affair across continents and oceans. Sadly, it is the inner teenager we appeal to when we send young men off to die in wars; but it is my belief that all those who have risked their lives to stand up against oppression and injustice called on their inner teenager too. Because when teenagers look at the status quo they see wrongs, and they name them truthfully, whether society wants to hear or not.The whole question of geekdom has interested me for a while too. Other people are involved in writing more about this, but I\\'ll take the liberty of pre-empting their more extensive study with a few thoughts. Firstly, what is a geek? Articles like Julian Dibbell\\'s \\'Lord of the Geeks\\' article on Village Voice seem to deride geeks as a minority of outsiders while simultaneously fearing that they\\'re some vast inchoate conspiracy which controls the technology underpinning our modern world. They\\'re losers, he thinks, but by some unfair twist of fate and genetics, they get to spend their lives doing cool things with art, science, technology, popular culture and the media. (And I might add that some of them get shockingly rich doing it too, and have to travel round the world for their pains.)My own definition of geeks is this: A geek cares about a subject or system so much that they\\'re willing to learn how to master it, whether anyone else cares about it or not. The link between geeks and teenagers exists because before that age, if a child is fascinated by something, we just think they\\'re absorbed in play. It\\'s only when they hit their teen years that we notice geeks because there\\'s some expectation that they should be out partying and socialising. Instead they sometimes - or often - put aside their interest in other people because they\\'d rather be problemsolving on their computer, or memorising the entire history of the Plantagenets, or thinking up stories about an imaginary world, or practicing scales for three hours on the violin. Sometimes they\\'re fixed on a goal known only to themselves, sometimes they\\'ve found a close-knit gang with similar interests, but in any case they\\'ll follow their own instincts or interests, no matter what anybody else thinks.The larger group of non-geeks is always going to be nervous of somebody who resists the easiest form of social control, which is shame. In their eyes, you should be able to laugh at somebody and tease them for being different, and that should be sufficient to make them toe the line and make a bit more of an effort to appear similar to everyone else. Geeks resist that because, well, it\\'d mean giving up the things that matter more than conformity.There\\'s always been geeks. Mozart? What a nerd! He had to be a geek. Who illuminated medieval manuscripts? Who preserved literacy during the difficult, violent centuries of the Dark Ages? Geek monks who remembered what civilisation was! Who were Pythagoras and Socrates and Archimedes? Total geeks every one of them, with their heads in the clouds.And so I ask, if anything worth doing is to be done: Are we not geeks?written by tehanu@theonering.net  urlLink Wonders of Math - The Game of Life  Other Wonders of Math  Fractals Chaos Tessellations Spirograph Knots Origami Conway\\'s Game of Life Mazes Lissajous Lab Roman Numeral Calculator Japan Scientists Grow Artificial Eyeball -Kyodo TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese scientists have succeeded in growing artificial eyeballs for the first time in the world, Kyodo news agency said Saturday.

Their proclivity to procrastinate and to overlook details complicates their circumstances. ENFPs often move on to new ventures without completing those they have already started. Their charming personalities can show signs of irritability and over-sensitivity when their desires to please different people come into conflict. During times of stress, ENFPs feel alienated. They then engage in deceptions that serve to obscure what is occurring within themselves.  The ENFP finds symbolic meanings behind the immediate circumstances. These meanings are construed as foreboding problems when ENFPs are under stress. Having a pervasive feeling of losing control over their own independent identities, ENFPs will feel virtually split apart by intruding circumstances. They will be \"besides themselves\" and \"just not all there\" \\x97 as if something, or someone, has taken away the essence of who they are. Not feeling like themselves, the ENFP will become subject to their own feelings of shame for being a phony, a fake or an impostor. If stress continues to grow, they may attribute malevolent schemes to others in order to explain away their fears.  urlLink Conflicting relationsThese are relations of constantly developing conflict. Conflicting relations have the worst compatibility between partners among all other relations. However, it does not seem to be so obvious, especially in the earlier stages of development. Conflicting partners appear rather attractive, interesting and with impressive abilities.Both partners are usually convinced that they can coexist and collaborate quite peacefully, but soon it becomes apparent that something is always going wrong, making their relationship problematic. Both partners may mistakenly think that the cause of these problems is minor and easily fixed and that all they need to do is to show a little bit more effort in understanding their partner.Unfortunately, these attempts to continue pushing their relationship any further will soon provoke an open conflict between the partners. When conflict starts, partners hit each other with arguments exactly in the direction where they can cause maximum pain. In return, the other partner may counterattack even more aggressively. With every conflict these relations become worse and worse.Although Conflicting partners show confidence where their partner is unconfident, they are unable to protect and take care of each other\\'s weak points. This regularly brings disagreement and disappointment into these relations. When after several fruitless attempts to establish a stable relationship the partners give up and break the relationship, they feel saved and released.ISTj - ENFpurlLink Abercrombie  Fitch Asian caricatures T-shirts cause outrage (04-18) 09:42 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --  A new line of T-shirts depicting stereotypes of Asians has triggered an e-mail and phone campaign to boycott clothier Abercrombie  Fitch, which caters to the young, active set.One of the Ohio-based company\\'s t-shirts reads \"Wong Brothers Laundry Service -- Two Wongs Can Make It White\" and shows two smiling men with slanted eyes wearing conical hats.Abercrombie said the shirts were supposed to be funny and cater to Asian customers.\"We personally thought Asians would love this T-shirt,\" said Hampton Carney, a spokesman for the company.The T-shirts prompted a late-night meeting of Stanford University students Wednesday.

More than two and one-half million adults divorce every year; and more than a million children become children of divorced parents.Divorce is a CRISIS of major proportions, second only to death of a spouse or parent in terms of the emotional trauma, stress, and upheaval it causes. According to the dictionary, a \"crisis\" is a situation whose outcome decides whether possible bad consequences will occur. That is, a crisis is not automatically a disaster; it is only potentially so. In fact, the Chinese word for crisis is composed of symbols meaning DANGER and OPPORTUNITY. The process of coming to terms with a divorce (or any other crisis/loss, for that matter) necessarily involves consideration of both its dangers and opportunities.The dangers associated with divorce can be summed up in one word--LOSS. Whether you are a partner willingly seeking divorce or a partner who is resisting the action or a child who has no choice in the matter, you will incur serious losses as a result of divorce. Recognizing the extent of the losses--economic losses, loss of your home, loss of previous social life, loss of daily contact with children, loss of household help (i.e., your partner) , loss of in-laws, loss of routine, to name a few--is the first step toward identifying, understanding, and resolving the wide range of intense feelings that accompany such losses.It is important to realize that the above losses result in emotional trauma. Reactions in the early stages of loss/trauma can include numbness, shock, and denial as well as helplessness, despair, and terror. In these early stages, it is helpful to acknowledge the losses and the tremendous pain associated with them; to remind yourself that you will survive; to recognize the universality of loss reactions and that you are not alone; to remind yourself that it is normal and healthy to experience pain with loss and encourage yourself to sit with the pain; to take care of yourself by getting rest, allowing friends to give you support, building in structure to counter the sense of being out of control, giving yourself room for mistakes, seeking out the comfort of others who have experienced similar losses; and seeking help and guidance immediately, if you think you need it.A later stage in the loss process involves aspects of mourning. Feelings most often associated with this stage are anger and depression. Again, it is important to understand and accept these feelings as legitimate. It is also important to give yourself time to experience and work through these feelings, rather than allowing yourself to run away through compulsive activities, new relationships, or acting out the feelings through self-defeating behaviors or activities.The dangers of divorce for children are similar to those listed above but more intense. For children, a divorce means the loss of their family as they have known it. This loss most often stimulates overwhelming fears of abandonment, threat, and disaster. Furthermore, most children lack the emotional equipment to deal constructively with these intense feelings. Thus, they often engage in acting-out behaviors which can bring on more trauma and loss. To help them cope with the dangers of divorce, children need direct, non-blaming and honest information about what is happening and what they can expect. They need reassurance that their parents are not divorcing them, and that the parent-child relationships will be preserved and protected at all costs. They need to be protected from the negative or bitter feelings in the marriage. They need structure and routine and consistency. Finally, they need help in identifying and legitimizing the many intense and scary emotions they are feeling. And they need to be given alternatives for expressing and coping with these feelings.As stated earlier, the crisis of divorce involves not only danger but also opportunity. Once the traumatic feelings of pain and loss are being managed and the survival stage worked through, one can approach the healing and growing stages of loss/divorce. The crisis of divorce necessarily presents new beginnings. it offers the opportunity for self-examination and self-renewal, which, in turn, bring growth and fulfillment. At this point, it is possible to view a divorce, not as a failure, but as a learning experience. Through such processes as forgiving (self and others) , focusing on the gain that comes from pain, taking constructive action, discovering new relationships and new interests, and rediscovering yourself, one is able to build joy, excitement, creativity, and peace back into your life. For many, they end up with a better life and self than they started with before the crisis.For most of us, the challenge of coping with both the dangers and opportunities of divorce are enormous. There are many books available to assist you in these challenges. Two useful ones are Divorcing by Kranzler and Belli (detailing the emotional and legal/logistical aspects of divorce) and How to Survive the Loss of a Love by Colgrove, Bloomfiled and McWilliams (dealing with emotional survival, healing, and growing from loss in general). Also be reminded that there are professionals on campus who understand the painful realities of divorce and who can help you survive and eventually thrive following divorce.

The End of MarriageThe hallmark of the marriage is the expectation that this is to be a permanent relationship, in which both partners commit their lives to one another, joining their individual lives together in mutual co-existence. Accordingly, the breakup of a marriage can be devastating and life disrupting.Divorce may be the sensible route to go for any number of reasons, but nevertheless unless completely amicable and acceptable to both parties, divorce represents the ending of a romance and the failure of a partnership in marriage, and is bound to have an emotional impact on one or both partners. Regardless of the circumstances of a divorce or the conditions that led up to it, the clear basis for any divorce work is the idea that the break up of a marriage is a loss.Divorce is composed of both \"technical\" and \"emotional\" aspects. The technical aspects will be taken care of, one way or another by the legal process. But the \"other\" side of the process deals with the emotional aftermath. This is \"divorce work\" -- the process of dealing with and working through the sense of loss, emotions, and situations caused by the divorce. The Emotional Stages of Divorce  Although every divorce is highly personal and unique, it can help divorcees to know that they\\'re not alone in their confusion and despair, and that things improve over time. At this difficult time, it can help to understand what\\'s typical in the divorce process, what to expect from their emotions and their life as their divorce progresses through the final decree and beyond, and the sort of emotional and practical issues that they\\'re likely to experience, and in what order. These are the \"emotional\" stages of divorce -- the sequence of feelings and issues that divorcees typically go through.The necessary emotional aspects of divorce work, include:  facing the reality of the divorce  working through painful feelings  experiencing the full range of emotions associated with the breakdown of a marriage  coping with the situational and lifestyle changes resulting from loss  adapting to the change, and reconfiguring life Stage 1:  \"Shock and Disbelief\" begins as soon as the idea of a separation and divorce is introduced and sinks in. It involves four major tasks and issues to be worked through.  Facing reality  Self esteem and inadequacy  Telling the world  Support and help Stage 2:  \"Initial Adjustment\" involves the ability of people to actively adapt to this new phase of their lives. The primary goal of this stage is adaptation and mustering the personal resources needed to manage the many emotional and practical changes faced by people during this phase of their divorce work, and tasks include:  Functioning and responsibility  Practical reality  Legal Matters  Managing emotions Stage 3:  \"Active Re-organization\" centers around how people live their lives and cope with the tasks of being suddenly single. Major tasks to be dealt with and worked through include:  Managing life style and practical affairs  Re-defining relationships  Reconstructing personal values and beliefs  Concluding legal procedures Stage 4:  \"Life Re-formation\" represents the final steps as readers pass through to the \"other\" side of their divorce. During this stage people deal with the emotional issues and life choices involved as they move on with their lives.  Constructing relationships  New interests  Personal responsibility  Accepting your new life Summary and Conclusion  The first stage of the divorce typically passes the most quickly. It\\'s the quick hit, and sometimes numbing shock wave, as people realize their marriage is over. The second and third stages are the most active and represent the bulk of active divorce work, covering the most active legal, practical, and emotional changes in life after divorce. The final stage represents that time in life during which divorcees are moving far away from their divorce, and into their new life. This stage really has no formal \"end,\" and is marked by the full acceptance of the divorce and a resolution of most of the practical issues and many of the emotional.Of course, the reality is that many of the various tasks of each stage overlap. And things aren\\'t as clean and neat as checking off one task and then moving on to the next. But helping divorcees recognize these stages and tasks can be an enormously useful way to help them see and understand the path that lies ahead for them.References:  Burns B.,  Whiteman, T.

Could you list other physical characteristics unique to males and females?Dr. Dobson Responds:  Men and women differ in countless ways, many of which they aren\\'t even conscious of. Here are just a few of those differences:1. A woman has greater constitutional vitality, perhaps because of her unique chromosomal pattern. Normally, she outlives a man by three or four years in the U.S. Females simply have a stronger hold on life than males, even in the uterus. More than 140 male babies are conceived for every 100 females; by the time birth occurs, the ratio is 105 to 100, with the rest of the males dying in spontaneous abortions.1592. Men have a higher incidence of death from almost every disease except three: benign tumors, disorders related to female reproduction, and breast cancer.1603. Men have a higher rate of basal metabolism than women.1614. The sexes differ in skeletal structure, women having a shorter head, broader face, less protruding chin, shorter legs, and longer trunk. The first finger of a woman\\'s hand is usually longer than the third; with men the reverse is true. Boys\\' teeth last longer than do those of girls.1625. Women have a larger stomach, kidneys, liver, and appendix, and smaller lungs than men.1636. Women have three very important physiological functions totally absent in men--menstruation, pregnancy, and lactation. Each of these mechanisms influences behavior and feelings significantly. Female hormonal patterns are more complex and varied. The glands work differently in the two sexes. For example, a woman\\'s thyroid is larger and more active; it enlarges during menstruation and pregnancy, which makes her more prone to goiter, provides resistance to cold, and is associated with the smooth skin, relatively hairless body, and the thin layer of subcutaneous fat that are important elements in the concept of personal beauty. Women are also more responsive emotionally, laughing and crying more readily.1647. Women\\'s blood contains more water (20 percent fewer red cells). Since red cells supply oxygen to the body, she tires more easily and is more prone to faint. Her constitutional viability is therefore strictly a long-range matter. When the working day in British factories, under wartime conditions, was increased from ten to twelve hours, accidents among women increased 150 percent; the rate of accidents among men did not increase significantly.1658. Men are 50 percent stronger than women in brute strength.1669. Women\\'s hearts beat more rapidly than those of men (80 versus 72 beats per minute). Their blood pressure (ten points lower than men) varies more from minute to minute, but they have much less tendency to high blood pressure--at least until after menopause.16710. Female lung capacity is about 30 percent less than in males.16811. Women can withstand high temperatures better than men because their metabolism slows down less.16912. Men and women differ in every cell of their bodies because they carry a differing chromosomal pattern. The implications of those genetic components range from obvious to extremely subtle. For example, when researchers visited high school and college campuses to study behavior of the sexes, they observed that males and females even transported their books in different ways. The young men tended to carry them at their sides with their arms looped over the top. Women and girls, by contrast, usually cradled their books at their breasts, in much the same way they would a baby.170Who can estimate how many other sex-related influences lie below the level of consciousness? urlLink Daily Zen MeditationOn a peak standing still Only clouds coming and going.

Date: Mon, 9 Sep 2002 19:27:36 -0600 From: Jafree To: HeatherUniqueness  Beyond superiority and inferiority  Every human being is unique. There is no question of anybody superior or anybody inferior. Yes, people are different.Let me remind you of one thing; otherwise you will misunderstand me. I am not saying that everybody is equal. Nobody is superior, nobody is inferior, but nobody is equal either. People are simply unique, incomparable. You are you, I am I. I have to contribute my potential to life, you have to contribute your potential to life. I have to discover my own being, you have to discover your own being.  When inferiority disappears, all feeling of superiority also disappears. They live together, they cannot be separated. The man who feels superior is still feeling inferior somewhere. The man who feels inferior wants to feel superior somewhere. They come in a pair; they are always there together; they cannot be separated.It happened... A very proud man, a warrior, a samurai, came to see a Zen master. The samurai was very famous, well known all over the country, But looking at the master, looking at the beauty of the master and the grace of the moment, he suddenly felt inferior. Maybe he had come with an unconscious desire to prove his superiority. He said to the master \"Why am I feeling inferior? Just a moment ago, everything was okay. As I entered into your court suddenly I felt inferior. I have never felt like that. My hands are shaking. I am a warrior, I have faced death many times, and I have never felt any fear--why am I feeling frightened?\"The master said, \"You wait. When everybody has gone, I will answer.\" People continued coming to visit the master, and the man was getting tired, more and more tired. By the evening the room was empty, there was nobody, and the samurai said, \"Now, can you answer it?\" And the master said, \"Now, come outside.\"A full moon night--the moon was just rising on the horizon... And he said, \"Look at these trees, this tree high in the sky and this small tree. They both have existed by the side of my window for years, and there has never been any problem. The smaller tree has never said, \\'Why do I feel inferior before you?\\' to the big tree. How is it possible? This tree is small, and that tree is big, and I have never heard any whisper.\"The samurai said, \"Because they can\\'t compare.\"The master said, \"Then you need not ask me; you know the answer.\"Comparison brings inferiority, superiority. When you don\\'t compare, all inferiority, all superiority, disappear. Then you are, you are simply there. A small bush or a big high tree--it doesn\\'t matter; you are yourself. You are needed. A grass leaf is needed as much as the biggest star. Without the grass leaf God will be less than he is. The sound of the cuckoo is needed as much as any Buddha; the world will be less, will be less rich if the cuckoo disappears.Just look around. All is needed, and everything fits together. It is an organic unity: nobody is higher and nobody is lower, nobody superior, nobody inferior. Everybody is incomparably unique.  urlLink Daily Zen MeditationGrace is within you; Grace is the Self.

It is something to do with the subject matter and the direct method of presentation. If we had time to discuss it we could refine that thought until we had something like this.The poems speak  - about experience from the senses  - directly and with intensity  - about observation of natureThey seek to construct a clear and significant image in our minds or perhaps to juxtapose or contrast two such images. Usually it is an image from nature or from daily life. Perhaps though, to say that the poem \\'constructs\\' the image in our mind is a bad way of saying it. Really the poem is reminding us of something we\\'ve already seen, heard or felt. That\\'s how they manage to conjure up so complex an image with so few words. One possibility is to go with what you know now.Let me first remind you of the rules I\\'ve already given you. The poem should be start with an image or a pair if them. It should be direct from sense experience, without metaphor, simile or rhyme. Haiku is of course a traditional Japanese form with further strict rules of construction. Not all are honoured outside Japan and even there some are defiantly broken. To what I\\'ve already stated let me add three more stipulations.three lines with 5 syllables, 7 syllables, then 5  one kigo or season word  one kireji or cutting wordThe first rule is the most well known and it is the one most mentioned by writers on the subject of haiku. The idea is simple. Write a line of five syllables, follow it with a seven-syllable line and then use five syllables to make the final line. This gives you two short lines divided by a longer one. It goes a long way to guiding the method of expression in the poem.There is a good deal of controversy about this rule; but let\\'s skip that for the moment and talk about the third. The kireji or cutting word is used to divide the haiku into two parts. Obviously this should be used to enhance the juxtaposition of images we discussed earlier. In English the tendency is to use punctuation, such as \"-\" or \":\" to perform this function.The second rule that requires the use of a kigo or season word helps establish the season or time of year that the poem describes. For English-language haiku this rule is taken to remind the writer that the poem should be grounded in nature.But most important is that the form isn\\'t the goal here. It\\'s to write a good poem. So the exercise of writing haiku oneself is very important. Occasional reading and discussion on the form, tradition and history of haiku and reading others\\' haiku all help to feed the writing with new ideas and approaches.African Ice Core Analysis Reveals Catastrophic Droughts, Shrinking Ice Fields, Civilization Shifts  COLUMBUS, Ohio \\x96 A detailed analysis of six cores retrieved from the rapidly shrinking ice fields atop Tanzania\\'s Mount Kilimanjaro shows that those tropical glaciers began to form about 11,700 years ago.

The beginning of each of the houses is called the cusp.  Each house has what is called a natural sign and natural ruling planets.  This is the sign and planet which are associated with that house in the natural chart beginning with Aries and ending with Pisces.  The Astrodienst charts show another division of the houses.  This division places the houses in groups that are on the angles, the angular (ang); houses that follow immediately behind each angular house, the succedent (suc) houses, and the third in line, the cadent (cad) houses. There are four each, angular, succedent, and cadent houses. Older books taught that planets in the angular houses were somewhat stronger and planets in the cadent houses were weaker in influence. Now little attention is paid to this idea.Osho Zen TarotPatienceWe have forgotten how to wait; it is almost an abandoned space. And it is our greatest  treasure to be able to wait for the right moment. The whole existence waits for the right  moment. Even trees know it--when it is time to bring the flowers and when it is time to let go  of all the leaves and stand naked against the sky. They are still beautiful in that nakedness,  waiting for the new foliage with a great trust that the old has gone, and the new will soon be  coming, and the new leaves will start growing. We have forgotten to wait, we want  everything in a hurry. It is a great loss to humanity.... In silence and waiting something inside  you goes on growing--your authentic being. And one day it jumps and becomes a flame, and  your whole personality is shattered; you are a new man. And this new man knows what  ceremony is, this new man knows life\\'s eternal juices. There are times when the only thing to do is to wait. The seed has been planted, the child is  growing in the womb, the oyster is coating the grain of sand and making it into a pearl. This  card reminds us that now is a time when all that is required is to be simply alert, patient, waiting. The woman pictured here is  in just such an attitude. Contented, with no trace of anxiety, she is simply waiting. Through all the phases of the moon  passing overhead she remains patient, so in tune with the rhythms of the moon that she has almost become one with it. She  knows it is a time to be passive, letting nature take its course. But she is neither sleepy nor indifferent; she knows it is time to  be ready for something momentous. It is a time full of mystery, like the hours just before the dawn. It is a time when the only  thing to do is to wait.  urlLink Robert E. Wilkinson \\'s The Quantum BrahmanIn their search to explain the mechanics of creation, the world\\'s leading theoretical physicists have determined that there are four fields of force in the universe. Scientists have been able to reduce and classify these fields in categories according to the strength of the force that they carry, and the particles with which they interact. The first of these categories is the Gravitational Force. It is the weakest of the four forces and has two special properties; it is able to act over large distances and is always an attractive force. The gravitational force is present in large bodies such as the Sun, Moon and Planets. The second category is the Electromagnetic Force which operates over short distances and interacts with electrically charged particles. While it is much stronger than the gravitational force, this force operates on the very small scale of atoms and molecules which possess two kinds of electrical charges, positive and negative, that tend to attract or repel one another. The third category called the Weak Nuclear Force, is responsible for radioactivity and is found in many nuclear decay processes that involve neutrinos. In 1979, scientists were able to develop a theory which successfully unified the weak nuclear force with the electromagnetic force as they had earlier been able to unify the forces of electricity and magnetism. It is now called the Electro-weak force. The fourth category, called the Strong Nuclear Force, binds particles together into combinations. Matter is mostly made up of protons and neutrons which in turn are made up of quarks. The strong nuclear force holds the quarks together in the proton and neutron and hold protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom.While these four forces account for the theoretical dynamics of matter they do not appear to interact with each other in a manner sufficient to suggest a single unified field theory which could explain the natural ordering of the universe. This problem has forced scientists to continue their search for an as yet unidentified 5th field in nature which they hope will provide the basis for this long sought unification. Their search for this mysterious 5th field has led them to speculate about a sub-quantum reality described by the ancient sages as the Luminiferous Ether. It was believed to be an invisible medium that would fill all space and convey extremely subtle effects over large distances. To the world of science, this metaphysical possibility was not considered viable because physicists were not convinced that etheric forces played any significant role in physical interactions. But, upon closer investigation, they have come to believe that the Etheric may hold the key to the elusive 5th field. Leading theoreticians now conclude that this invisible sub-quantum field, capable of being the ground state of the universe, would be free of matter as well as the effects of gravitation. Since it resembles empty space, they appropriately named it the Quantum Vacuum. However, following more recent discoveries, they were forced to revise their notion of an etheric void in favor of new theories which suggest that the Quantum Vacuum is a highly charged cosmic medium; an energy-filled plenum whose subtle order measurably influences the space-time motion of the material universe. Scientists now agree that it was the Quantum Vacuum which gave birth to the observable universe. And they also believe that the 5th field which they are seeking is the interactive face of that plenum. A number of physicists now suspect that the dynamics of that interactive face hold the key to joining the fields of gravitation, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces in a Grand Unified Field Formula.The discovery of the Quantum Vacuum appears to represent a major paradigm shift for modern science but, at this point in time, very little is actually known about this puzzling phenomenon. Physicists cautiously agree that the Quantum Vacuum gave birth to the observable universe; that it is the source and sink of all matter and, that it may prove to influence the space-time motion of matter. There is even a growing consensus among scientists that Vacuum Physics lie at the core of everything. But, in spite of all these advances, they are still faced with a monumental problem; the discovery of the Quantum Vacuum has not really solved anything, it merely postulated a zero point beyond which empirical science cannot go. They have finally arrived at the womb of creation, but it is exactly as the ancient sages always said, unmeasurable. The laws of physics break down at this resonant threshold because they are unable to measure its infinite density.In order for science to arrive at a new system of knowledge which can unveil the interactive face of the Quantum Vacuum and measure the density of the Transcendent, it must first be willing to entertain a new understanding of Time. For Time is the key which unlocks the secrets of matter. For centuries physicists have been laboring under the illusion that Time was a derivative of Space even to the point of calling it \\'Space-time\\' but, according to the sages, it is quite the opposite; Time is what gives birth to Space.In his commentaries on the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, one of India\\'s oldest and most profound metaphysical texts, the philosopher-sage, Sri Aurobindo discusses the occult imagery associated with this fundamental principle:\" ... The [image of the] horse is a physical figure representing like an algebraical symbol, an unknown quantity of force and speed. (Time is its breath, the year is its body, the seasons its limbs, the months and the fortnights its joints, the days and nights its feet.) From the imagery it is evident that this force, this speed, is something universal. Time in its period is the Self of the Horse Sacrificial, so not Matter but Time, is the body of this force of the material universe... Space then, is the flesh constituting materially this body of Time which the sage attributes to his Horse of the worlds, by movement in Space its periods are shaped and determined. Hence the real power, the fundamental greatness of the Horse is not the material world, not the magnitudes of Space, but the magnitudes of Time... for Time is that mysterious condition of universal mind which alone makes the ordering of the universe in Space possible.\"Sri Aurobindo, The Upanishads; \\'The Great Aranyaka\\', Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press, 1971  In the higher ranges of consciousness, which the sages identify as the realm of pattern, all things exist in potentia, they are not here manifest. They may exist in Being but not in Time. They are precipitated into physical reality by the contracting power of Time. For it is Saturn/Chronos which differentiates the infinite energy-consciousness of the Supreme Godhead into material form.In its native state, the Absolute is unbound, undifferentiated and eternal; One without a second. In order for the Incomprehensible to become intelligible to itself, it becomes dense, first becoming audible and then visible. It does this through a process of contraction which slows down the vibrations of the infinite consciousness, gradually congealing it into a spatial field containing material forms. It manifests first as Cosmic and Planetary harmonies before reaching a highly specific individuation in the human domain. Through this alchemical process, the Absolute is reduced from its original state of undifferentiated Unity into Form and Multiplicity. This act of contraction, is the basis upon which the Greek myths portray Saturn/Chronos as having dismembered his father.In order to break the code of the Transcendent dimension, science must reverse this process of divine alchemy. It must abandon its philosophy of continued dismemberment or scientific reductionism in favor of a cosmological, or whole systems approach. Scientists must learn to embrace the view that material reality is not a collection of separate objects as it appears, but an undivided whole in which all parts merge and unite in one totality. Fortunately there are some theorists who recognize this possibility and are beginning to agree that the next great paradigm shift in science will be a cosmological revolution, because Cosmology, once the mother of all science, embraces the whole of reality and describes its order.One of the most impressive theories emerging out of scientific cosmology respecting these ancient truths was set forth by the late physicist, David Bohm in his book, Wholeness and the Implicate Order. Using the language of mathematics, Bohm set out to describe the transcendent reality and its graded energetic hierarchy in four basic states or orders of energy beginning with the physical world, which he called the Explicate Order.\"The Explicate Order, weakest of all energy systems, resonates out of and is an expression of an infinitely more powerful order of energy called the Implicate order. It is the precursor of the Explicate, the dreamlike vision or the ideal presentation of that which is to become manifest as a physical object. The Implicate order implies within it all physical universes. However, it resonates from an energy field which is yet greater, the realm of pure potential. It is pure potential because nothing is implied within it; implications form in the implicate order and then express themselves in the explicate order. Bohm goes on to postulate a final state of infinite [zero point] energy which he calls the realm of insight intelligence. The creative process springs from this realm. Energy is generated there, gathers its pure potential, and implies within its eventual expression as the explicate order.\"Will Keepin, David Bohm, Noetic Science Journal  When Bohm\\'s resonant fields are arranged in a vibrational hierarchy they represent energy in successive states of manifestation from infinitely subtle to the gross physical reality.The Zero Point Order which Bohm identified as the realm of insight-intelligence bears an unmistakable resemblance to the supreme spiritual realization of Indian metaphysics known as the Brahman, a perfectly inactive, pure noetic plenum realized as Absolute Being. Realization of the Brahman is characterized by a complete fusion of Time and Consciousness which we experience as Timelessness, or undifferentiated Time. In this state Time-energy vibrates at such an intense rate that is appears static and thereby lacking any element of periodicity or denseness. Hence it cannot produce any form or any division of Consciousness-substance into distinct crystallised objects in Space.In the language of physics the Brahman would be infinite creativity in a resting or seemingly non-vibratory state, realized as Emptiness or a Void. It appears this way because, as energy moves toward an infinite state, its wave frequency increases. The amplitude or vertical distance between wave crests becomes smaller and smaller until the points of rest overlap, turning the oscillating wave into a straight line. In this manner, infinite energy may be realized as utter stillness or a zero point, precisely as the sages have said. Bohm obtained laboratory evidence of this phenomenon by proving the existence of wave lengths as small as 10 to the minus 34th power. His calculations indicate that one cubic centimeter of this Zero Point energy contains more power than all of the matter in the known universe.Bohm\\'s work with Zero Point energy is extremely helpful in understanding the metaphysical nature of the universe, especially the process by which the Absolute or Brahman becomes manifest in Time and Space. And while he was never able to define the details of that process, his groundbreaking theories represent a major paradigm shift, not only for the world of science but for spirituality as well, because, like Sri Aurobindo, Bohm\\'s discoveries contradict the perennial philosophy which posits Emptiness or a Void as the highest spiritual realization.\"Nothing can arise from Nothing. Asat, nothingness, is a creation of our mind; where it cannot see or conceive, where its object is something beyond its grasp, too much beyond to give even the sense of a vague intangibility, then it cries out, \"Here there is nothing.\" Out of its own incapacity it has created the conception of a zero. But what in truth is this zero? It is an incalculable Infinite... Our sense by its incapacity has invented darkness. In truth there is nothing but Light, only it is a power of light either above or below our poor human vision\\'s limited range.\"  Sri Aurobindo, The Web of Yoga, Centenary Edition, Vol. 17, p. 48  Bohm\\'s breakthroughs in quantum physics have opened the way for a new and productive relationship between ancient wisdom and modern science because, for the first time, they establish Fullness rather than a Void as the ground state of the universe. The implications of this discovery are immense, not only because it offers science a new conceptual paradigm which may hold the key to grand unification but it lays the foundation for a new cosmology in which the polarities of Spirit and Matter may finally be joined in an integral synthesis harmonizing the various expressions of mind, life and matter.While these new theories hold exciting possibilities for science, they have been known and understood for millennia by the philosopher-sages of Vedic India. Long ago the Rishis postulated the existence of 5 fields with the 5th being the Etheric Plenum, or Fullness from which all things emerge. According to them, our material universe arose from a point or seed which lies at the resonant threshold of that Etheric Plenum. The Atharva Veda describes that point or seed as an \\'Embryo [Hiranyagarbha] which, in the beginning, poured forth upon the universe a stream of gold.\\' This embryo or seed lies at the intersection of Time and Space, Spirit and Matter, where involutionary forms move across the event horizon and begin their linear evolution. In the language of scientific cosmology, this point or Seed is the singularity from which the universe exploded into being. In metaphysical terms it is the Luminiferous Ether, the OM or primordial vibration out of which the universe emerges and has its origin. All material creation issues from this original involved point or seed as involutionary forms move across the spatial threshold and begin to evolve linearly in accordance with the laws of causation and the principles of time. Once it crosses that resonant threshold the material universe is obliged to unfold in a manner that allows the Seer to follow the evolving in our Time measure of what was involved in that seed by compression or contraction.Knowledge of this involutionary process was the most coveted secret of the Vedic Rishis because It allowed them to follow the unfolding of that Seed and \\'See\\' with an understanding which could be infinitely extended to all orders of reality. They were able to observe this occult process by using a unique system of cosmological knowledge which could measure from the Transcendent reality to its physical manifestation in an unbroken line. This knowledge was hidden in the symbol language of the Rig Veda but over the millennia its meaning became clouded over. The Seer became displaced by the Nirvani as emphasis shifted from Gnosis to a philosophy of Illusionism which denied the material world in favor of the attainment of a Transcendent consciousness. As a result of this development, the bridge between the Transcendent and the Physical became lost and was soon considered irrelevant. It was understood that the Brahman permeated everything, but how it had become the All was once again a great mystery.\"When the realiser could no longer use the cosmos to express his spiritual experience, he introduced the cleavage...between form and essence. More importantly, that essence itself became deformed. The experience conveyed an unfocused vision of what is and immediately nothingness and voids became the way to describe that higher truth. This was a logical development in a world in which the cosmos lost its sense, its purpose and its relation of oneness to the human being and evolution of consciousness on Earth. Above all, creation became divested of true sacredness.\"Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, The Vishaal Newsletter, October, 1988  Today, some two thousand years later, Science and Spirituality must face the consequences of these philosophies of illusionism which taught that Truth or Salvation, if it is to be attained at all, may only be realized in an afterdeath heaven or Nirvanic void - anywhere except the physical world we inhabit. The influence of these nihilistic philosophies has driven Science and Spirituality to the threshold of a major crisis in which both must discover a new and integrative paradigm in order to experience a meaningful continuity of existence. The key to that paradigm is a new understanding of Time and its primary role bridging the Transcendent and the Physical world.\"It cannot be denied that Time is a major feature of our material universe. In consequence, it stands to reason that when spirituality decides that the universal manifestation is unreal and illusory, Time is immediately shunned and the seeker is required to go \\'beyond time\\', i.e., to the experience that appears to obliterate Time. Conversely, if we are engaged in a path that seeks a transformation of matter and an experience of the highest planes of reality in this material creation we are obliged to accept the instrumentation of Time. Furthermore, we must seek a means or a key by which Time itself becomes the element utilized in the gestation of a new and superior consciousness-form in the material creation.\"Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, The New Way, Vol. 3, 1983  In the early 1970\\'s Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, the world\\'s leading authority on Vedic Cosmology, began to publish her ground breaking discoveries. She had recognized in the scriptures and mythologies of ancient India evidence of a highly enlightened cosmological culture. The Rishis, had developed precise formulas describing the dynamics of the involutionary process, and had woven these celestial equations into the structure of their myths and legends. Their knowledge of Time and the cosmic mysteries formed the basis of an ancient Yoga, the practice of which led to a supremely enlightened state known as Truth-Consciousness or Swar of the Veda. The Rishis understood that the Cosmos was a whole organism, multidimensional and sacred in its structure and form. They also knew that the difference between man/woman and the Cosmos was a matter of degree, rather than essence; that the Macrocosm and Microcosm had a correspondent equivalence. Through the repetition of certain rites, the sages believed that man could recover an awareness of his intrinsic identity with the Cosmos and thus perceive the hidden order of the world. Since this order was embedded in the structure and periodic movement of the Macrocosm, it was understood that a corresponding order could be discovered by the individual in the cycles and events of his own life. If man could learn to align himself with the harmonies of Cosmic Time, he would gradually become imprinted with their rhythms and realize within himself an immutable center or axis, from which he could acquire an entirely new orientation to his lived experience. Since the same Zero Womb, which gave birth to the universe is also the core of the human being, the unveiling of this Soul/center/axis in the individual led to a simultaneous realization of Truth-Consciousness or Gnosis.This was the essence of the Rig Vedic Yoga, lost for millennia until it was unveiled in the 1970\\'s by Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet. From the principles of these ancient teachings, Ms. Norelli-Bachelet developed and articulated a new applied cosmology which she demonstrates in her book, The Gnostic Circle, a synthesis in the harmonies of the cosmos.\"The Gnostic Circle is merely the combination of the zodiac the occult circle which contains the knowledge of the evolution and the structural pattern of the solar system. The Circle of 12 is the zodiac, and the Circle of 9 is our actual solar system, each orbit representing one year of Earth life. The joint harmony of these two, superimposed or synthesized in one circle, is what constitutes our key to the evolution and flowering of the seed of the Spirit. In fact we can say that the Gnostic Circle is mainly for this purpose: it shows mankind the ultimate and ideal perfection that can be attained during this particular phase of the evolution, during this great transition point from animal-mental to the more divine mankind.\"Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet ,The Gnostic Circle, p. 159, 1975  Ms. Norelli-Bachelet deals with what, for centuries, has been divorced from traditional spirituality, the question of Time and Measure. Her cosmology reverses the long-standing perception of Time as the destroyer and presents mankind with an entirely new awareness of Time as the integrative mechanism by which a Divine purpose is expressed in the world. Her seminal work discloses the deepest truths of material Reality which include the Being as well as the dynamics of the Becoming of that same Being. \"Time\", says Norelli-Bachelet, \"is the vehicle, the medium for the Absolute or Supreme Consciousness to be and to become and it is knowledge of this principle which integrates the Spiritual and Physical dimensions and grants the individual a direct experience of the Supreme within the physical manifestation .\"In Ms. Norelli-Bachelet\\'s Cosmology, the Zero Womb or what science is now calling the Quantum Vacuum, has a symbolic correspondence to the Sun or primary Axis of our own Universe. The nine planets which orbit about the Sun represent the octaves or archetypes of form which have issued from that Zero/Womb/Axis. The planets also represent the number powers from 1 to 9 which form the mathematical basis of an ancient system of number harmonies called Cabalistic Reduction. Since every higher number is reducible to a simple number from 1 to 9, it is by means of number power that one is able to integrate the planetary harmonies with the harmonics of Number and relate the movement of the spheres to the Calendar which measures time periods on earth. Through this system of cosmic harmonies, the Gnostic Circle unveils the dynamic correspondences between Time and Space and describes the occult process by which energy-consciousness becomes crystallized into material forms.By unveiling the Quantum Brahman or body of the Absolute, Ms. Norelli-Bachelet reveals for the first time the complete details of the involutionary process which occurs in the Zero Womb, and the reversal, or emergence from its interactive face of solidified energy or material form. She has rebuilt the bridge between Spirit and Matter in a seamless continuum, using the harmonics of our very own cosmos to describe its order. Through the use of her Gnostic Circle we now have the means to measure the dynamics of that Implicate reality and follow its manifestation in time as the Explicate universe. Ms. Norelli-Bachelet\\'s work represents a quantum leap in cosmological knowledge and contains the seeds of a unique synthesis which promises to open the way for new and revolutionary advances in both science and spirituality.2/12/96Robert E.

Box 396  Accord, New York 12404urlLink No-Shame, No-Blame Creation Storyby Clare PuskarczykIn the beginning...  there was an entity of light  within a lovely garden  which was also made of light.  A single being, with many aspects  living in peace and harmony.  When a serpent,  who knew well of matter said,  \"Birth, Death, Rebirth.\"  The quality of the light being  that would become known  as the feminine said,  \"Why Not? Exploration, process.\"  The masculine energy said,  \"Structure, power.\"  And the serpent said,  Be aware, you may forget  who and what you really are.\"  She said, \"We\\'ll remember.\"  And she said to the masculine energy,  \"I\\'ll remind you of our light.\"  And he agreed,  and so they split in two,  into two separate beings,  and the Universe around them  became a duality, And they forgot.  And everything became heavy and  matter now mattered most of all.  Gravity became grave  in its seriousness  and grave as in death,  and they suffered,  and became ill,  and felt lost  and sometimes,  they almost remembered...  something.  and there were times...  when there was joy and light  but always a longing  to get back out of matter.  back to where?  And so they began to learn  how to use matter  and they thought they were powerful  and so a great battle began.  Everyone wanted to have power  power over matter  power over each other  power over thoughts and feelings  power over structures  especially the masculine beings  because their focus was structure.  And they took things apart  and made more...things.And often...there was fear,  fear of each other,  fear of thoughts  feelings,  fear of the loss of structure.Structures became institutions  But the feminine beings  were not preoccupied  with the institutions.  Instead they were occupied  with life,  with nature,  with babies  and a different order of things.Sometimes...  she would remind him  of something,  but he thought he would  lose his power  if he remembered  and so he remained...forgetful.And for this... he held power over her,  power over nature,  power over his own natural self,  as in control, repression, structure.Fear kept these beings time-bound  and distanced them  from their light inside,  and their light remained interior  while they took everything apart.Discovery pulled them forward  until almost everything  large and small  was in pieces.  what they didn\\'t know was that  the external world was becoming  a reflection of themselves,  fragmented selves  with fragmented thoughts,  conflicts unresolved,  split inside.And the external world  reflected opposites everywhere as in:  Good people don\\'t kill, but...  we must have  war  weapons  to keep our power.  Good people don\\'t lie, but...  we must deny and deceive  to keep our power.  Good people don\\'t harm, but...  we must argue and abuse  to keep our power.Yet behind all of this  there was still light,  and there were  those who would remember  something  and living differently  some of them stood out  as heroes...strangely enough.Finally...  after many thousands of years,  when the world was full of  war and weapons,  denial and deception  and abuse of every kind,  and matter had contracted  as far as it could go,  little sparks of light  began to flash  more  more often  and remembering  began to manifest as:  concern for the environment,  conflict resolution,  love for one another  with integration and wholeness  bringing the fragments  back together.Now...  individuals were creating community,  scientists discovering quantum leaps,  spiritual psychology learning  and teaching empowerment,  and the lights became brighter still.Soon there were those  who remembered very well  that power was indeed interior,  that everything was made of light,  that evil meant  to live backwards in fear, and  that trust had  the vibrational quality  to bring light forward.And that everyone together  had been Making it all up!Even still...  people seemed to take sides.  And in the end,  those full of light  looked at those full of fear  and saw their light hidden inside  and loved them.And those full of fear  looked at those full of love  and saw their light  and remembered their own,  and they all remembered together  and began to lighten up.

I think - therefore I am  You create your world! No other concept possesses the power that this idea does. Think about it? The power to change your world rests within yourself \\x96 within your mind! Thought-creation is a fact of reality, all realities. This physical reality however, would often have you believe otherwise. When you believe that your fate is in the hands of people and things that are beyond your control, you lose that fundamental power given to you: the power to create. You make it that much easier for others to manipulate and change your world into what they want, instead of changing your world into what you want. Remember! You have a right to create your own world. That right to create your own world was a gift to you from divine powers \\x96 divine powers, we might add \\x96 who cherish that right themselves. They would not think of relinquishing their power of self-creation and neither should you. Except, every time you feel that a particular situation is out of your hands, then that is what you are doing: relinquishing your power of creation and your ability to change the situation. To reclaim back your creative power involves taking two steps, changing your belief, and learning how to control the consciousness you possess. Doing both will take time. However, the sooner you begin, the sooner you will reap the benefits of deliberate reality-creation. To begin, you must shift from the belief that you live in a world you can\\x92t control, to a belief that you live in a world you can control. Along with this new belief, you must come to understand that the high-tech reality controlling device that you seek is your own consciousness. Your consciousness is the tool given to you by the divine that will enable you to change and shape your reality. Learning how to control that consciousness is the next step in the process. Good reality-control comes from within, not without. An uncontrolled consciousness can be like a wild, untamed animal. This untamed animal gets driven by many sources to do the things it does, like emotions, needs, and desires. All these factors play a part in controlling and directing your consciousness toward deliberate reality creation. Except, in an uncontrolled state, your consciousness roams freely, like a wild beast. When a particular factor overwhelms the beast, that factor becomes the new director of the beast\\x92s world. This haphazard direction of consciousness is what you want to avoid. Your consciousness\\x92s driving forces must all be tamed and shown how they can work together to obtain what each needs and wants. Now, to help make our point, let\\x92s take a few moments and show you a few common patterns that indicate a wild and untamed consciousness.Does you mind wander regularly \\x96 jumping from topic to topic? In other words, if you counted the amount of things your mind dwelled on, during a given hour, would the number be above five items? Anything above five items, in a one hour period, points to mind-wandering. Mind wandering is one of the more subtle ways you undermine your reality control and a sure sign you have the makings of an untamed beast.Do you continually look on the negative side of things? A negative outlook on your life is a sign that your emotions are controlling your consciousness \\x96 not you! Emotions, when used properly, can be a good motivator of reality creating. However, when you allow your emotions free reign, the beastly side of them takes over. Emotional runaway is the most destructive form of reality control and another strong indicator of a wild beast within.Do you often feel mentally drained? Continual mental fatigue is an indication of poor inner-power regulation. With inadequate inner-power and poor inner-power control you can expect anything and everything to control your life. If you lack the inner-power and strength necessary to make the needed changes in your world, all the mental control in the world is not going to help you. Poor inner-power management is another way of self-defeating reality control and yet another example of something savage going on within you.Do you consciously understand the mechanics behind thought-creation? Not knowing how a device operates \\x96 especially an inner device \\x96 can greatly hinder your ability to use it. A computer is no good if you haven\\x92t a clue how to operate it! Thought-creation is the same. Your consciousness needs to understand how to operate the inner and outer devices that enable you to control your world. Otherwise, you\\x92ll be like a wild animal searching for food, operating on instinct alone. While the animal may eat, it may not eat well or at all on some days. So, if you don\\x92t understand these inner and outer creation devices, your consciousness is operating on instinct alone and is operating on a very primitive level. I\\x92m sure many of you answered \\x91yes\\x92 to some of these questions. Answering \\x91yes\\x92 does not make you a misfit; it just makes you unlearned. Being unlearned in the way consciousness does its job is inefficient and a waste of your personal resources. Because you live in a fast-changing world, deliberate reality control becomes a necessity. You must learn how to tame that beast, so that you can make your world the best it can be, for yourself and for others. With a controlled and tamed consciousness you can expect some changes in the way things happen in your life. For one thing, nothing unpleasant will surprise you. You will create the world you want and need. There will be no lurking ugliness that will spring up at the last minute. If you do get ugliness, you will be aware of it well in advance because you will be aware of yourself creating it. Your mind will no longer be an unchartered territory. You will be fully aware of the contents of your mind at any given time. Plus, you will understand why you react in certain ways and in certain situations. When an awkward, unwanted, or an unusual situation arises, you will have the power to act and the power to move that situation in a direction that is desirable to you. You will be the master of your fate and the helmsman of your destiny. You create your world! No other statement is more true. Now it is your job to learn how. Take the first step toward controlling your reality, and we can help you with the second. Recognize, at least a little, that you can and do have the power to create your world. You\\x92ve been doing it for years, since you were born and before. Then, let\\x92s take that second step together and learn how to properly use those inner tools \\x96 inner tools that will enable you to control the greatest gift in your possession, your own consciousness.Worksheet Notes:On the next page is your first worksheet. It is a questionnaire designed to show you your present level of reality creating ability. Please take the time to fill in the questionnaire because the real power in this questionnaire will reveal itself when you come back to it, after you\\x92ve finished the \\x93Hermes\\x92 Reality Creator I\\x94 course and retake the test. Your new score will show you how much you have progressed and how much farther you need to work the Reality Creating Game. Each question is designed to alert you to a different area of reality creating skill.Question one shows you how positively you think about your reality.  Question two shows you how well you can control your lower self, your more base instincts, the animal part of you, if you will.  Question three shows you how well you can keep your mind focused in the present moment.  Question four shows you how well you can regulate your inner power (energy).  Question five shows you how easily you can be coerced by others.After you take the test, then move on to the next chapter, but keep in mind the areas that you need to work on.

It may be similar to the situation with the risk of blood clots with long distance air travel. The man, the first recorded victim of a condition which has been dubbed e-thrombosis, spent up to 18 hours a day using his computer. He developed a massive blood clot that formed in his leg veins, broke off and travelled to his lungs.Although the controversy about long-haul air travel has recently put DVT in the headlines, the condition was first described in people sitting on deckchairs in air raid shelters during the Blitz in London.

Nicotine acts on cells in the \\x93reward center\\x94 of the brain.  This results in feelings of pleasure and alertness- the \"hit\" that your body comes to expect.  When bloodstream nicotine levels are at their peak, the brain is highly stimulated.  However, within just 30 minutes, your body has cleaned out most of the nicotine.  You then feel tired, jittery, depressed, or fatigued.  You begin to crave another cigarette, and the cycle continues.  This cycle, which increases in intensity and frequency over time, is part of what makes cigarettes so addictive.Essentially, smoking becomes a never-ending battle of trying to stay within the \\x91comfort zone\\x92.urlLink Help for Cravings and Tough Situations What to Do Right Now and to Create a Smoke-free Future  For the first few days after you quit, spend as much free time as possible in places where smoking is prohibited - libraries, museums, theaters, churches.  Drink a lot of water and fruit juice.  Don\\'t drink alcohol, coffee, and other beverages that you associate with smoking.  Strike up a conversation instead of a match for a cigarette.  If you miss the feeling of having a cigarette in your hand, play with something else - a pencil, a paperclip, a marble.  If you miss the feeling of having something in your mouth, try toothpicks, cinnamon sticks or celery.  AVOID TEMPTATION by staying away from situations you associate with pleasurable smoking.  FIND NEW HABITS and create a non-smoking environment around you.  Keep from picking up the habit again by anticipating future situations/crises that might make you want to smoke again, and remind yourself of your reasons to not give in.  Take deep rhythmic breaths similar to smoking to relax.  Remember your goal and the fact that the urge will eventually pass.  Think positive thoughts and avoid negative ones.  Brush your teeth.  Do brief bursts of exercise (isometrics, pushups, deep knee bends, walk up a flight of stairs, or touch your toes).

Like their companion in the Earth signs, Taurus, there isn\\x92t the headlong rushing into commitments, either. Virgoan Moons don\\x92t overanalyze the relationship as much as they look at the value the relationship may have for themselves. They may hesitate to move at all unless they feel they are on solid ground, or there is some personal advantage to be gained by their emotional involvement.As lunar Earth sign personalities, those with Moon in Virgo are guarded about their feelings. Virgoan Moons don\\x92t much care for discussing openly their emotions as if reporting their portfolio. This is not an ego issue like their neighbor, Leo, as much as it is a ploy to intrigue others to get to know them more intimately. It isn\\x92t easy loving a person with a Virgo Moon because they are over-critical in emotional expressions. Believe it or not, this Moon sign may actually be unrealistic at times about their own emotions. Their passion can sometimes be confused with compassion. An over-critical or too analytical approach to emotional situations makes it difficult for them (as well as the others involved) to freely or spontaneously express feelings. Serious-minded, with common sense about most things, they can be surprisingly unrealistic. As a result, they tend to gravitate to situations they know eel rather than explore and be adventuresome with their emotions. This leads Virgoan Moons too often repeating the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result each time and not getting it.  Virgo Moon personalities are emotionally adaptable. They instinctively seem to know what it takes to make others feel better. They make many friends because of their sympathetic nature, but it also means they are vulnerable to being exploited. Though they are not all scholars, they are likely to be fond of books and writing. Intellectual curiosity gives them a penchant for gathering information that can develop into serious research endeavors, or turn out to be just a fondness for gossip. At times they can be overly fastidious, usually with regard to eating habits. Concern with health makes many of them outstanding health care professionals. Their own preoccupation with health can become exaggerated to the point of hypochondria, or they can be guilty of using maladies to attract sympathy. They are mentally and emotionally stimulated by travel, communication, and information. Subject: Remembering Martin Luther King, Jr. Date:  Fri, 17 Jan 2003 13:58:56 -0800 From: \"FAIR\"  To:  \"FAIR-L\" FAIR-LFairness  Accuracy In Reporting Media analysis, critiques and activismRemembering Martin Luther King, Jr.This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day comes as the U.S. is moving toward war in Iraq. As media prepare to air retrospectives on King, we thought it would be a good time to circulate this 1995 column by FAIR founder Jeff Cohen and FAIR associate Norman Solomon.------------------ Media Beat, January 4, 1995 The Martin Luther King You Don\\'t See on TV By Jeff Cohen and Norman Solomon  It\\'s become a TV ritual: Every year in mid-January, around the time of Martin Luther King\\'s birthday, we get perfunctory network news reports about \"the slain civil rights leader.\"  The remarkable thing about this annual review of King\\'s life is that several years-- his last years-- are totally missing, as if flushed down a memory hole.  What TV viewers see is a closed loop of familiar file footage: King battling desegregation in Birmingham (1963); reciting his dream of racial harmony at the rally in Washington (1963); marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama (1965); and finally, lying dead on the motel balcony in Memphis (1968).  An alert viewer might notice that the chronology jumps from 1965 to 1968. Yet King didn\\'t take a sabbatical near the end of his life. In fact, he was speaking and organizing as diligently as ever.  Almost all of those speeches were filmed or taped. But they\\'re not shown today on TV.  Why?  It\\'s because national news media have never come to terms with what Martin Luther King Jr. stood for during his final years.  In the early 1960s, when King focused his challenge on legalized racial discrimination in the South, most major media were his allies. Network TV and national publications graphically showed the police dogs and bullwhips and cattle prods used against Southern blacks who sought the right to vote or to eat at a public lunch counter.  But after passage of civil rights acts in 1964 and 1965, King began challenging the nation\\'s fundamental priorities. He maintained that civil rights laws were empty without \"human rights\"-- including economic rights. For people too poor to eat at a restaurant or afford a decent home, King said, anti-discrimination laws were hollow.  Noting that a majority of Americans below the poverty line were white, King developed a class perspective. He decried the huge income gaps between rich and poor, and called for \"radical changes in the structure of our society\" to redistribute wealth and power.  \"True compassion,\" King declared, \"is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.\"  By 1967, King had also become the country\\'s most prominent opponent of the Vietnam War, and a staunch critic of overall U.S. foreign policy, which he deemed militaristic. In his \"Beyond Vietnam\" speech delivered at New York\\'s Riverside Church on April 4, 1967-- a year to the day before he was murdered-- King called the United States \"the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.\"  >From Vietnam to South Africa to Latin America, King said, the U.S. was \"on the wrong side of a world revolution.\" King questioned \"our alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America,\" and asked why the U.S. was suppressing revolutions \"of the shirtless and barefoot people\" in the Third World, instead of supporting them.  In foreign policy, King also offered an economic critique, complaining about \"capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries.\"  You haven\\'t heard the \"Beyond Vietnam\" speech on network news retrospectives, but national media heard it loud and clear back in 1967-- and loudly denounced it. Time magazine called it \"demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi.\" The Washington Post patronized that \"King has diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people.\"  In his last months, King was organizing the most militant project of his life: the Poor People\\'s Campaign. He crisscrossed the country to assemble \"a multiracial army of the poor\" that would descend on Washington-- engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol, if need be-- until Congress enacted a poor people\\'s bill of rights. Reader\\'s Digest warned of an \"insurrection.\"  King\\'s economic bill of rights called for massive government jobs programs to rebuild America\\'s cities. He saw a crying need to confront a Congress that had demonstrated its \"hostility to the poor\"-- appropriating \"military funds with alacrity and generosity,\" but providing \"poverty funds with miserliness.\"  How familiar that sounds today, more than a quarter-century after King\\'s efforts on behalf of the poor people\\'s mobilization were cut short by an assassin\\'s bullet.  As 1995 gets underway, in this nation of immense wealth, the White House and Congress continue to accept the perpetuation of poverty. And so do most mass media. Perhaps it\\'s no surprise that they tell us little about the last years of Martin Luther King\\'s life.  ------------------ Media Beat is Norman Solomon\\'s weekly syndicated column on media and politics.

Gather the Women is evoking at a profound level  an experience of our own woman\\'s worth to the world.As women we bring life forward.  We are in touch with the cycles of life and we function in a context that is deeply relational.  This realization is allowing women to risk leaving  the safety of our comfortable conformities.  We have the capacity to generate  creative solutions that benefit  all life on the planet.  Gather the Women is creating  a rich exchange of cultural values  to dissolve the ties that bind us to the illusion  that one segment of our human family can win  while another loses.  Together we women are contributing  to a new collective wisdom  and we are lending our strength  to that which we wish to embrace.  From this emerging balance is being born  a new dimension of our humanity. Nicotine is the addicting chemical in all forms of tobacco. It is a very powerful and dangerous drug - a small child can die from eating just two cigarettes. Nicotine causes the release of brain chemicals, which can give a \"high\" similar to other addicting drugs. It may be as addicting as heroin. The body goes through a physical \"withdrawal\" when the nicotine level drops - causing the \"nicotine fit.\"Nicotine withdrawal can be very unpleasant - many smokers find it difficult to quit due to nicotine addiction. Withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, restlessness, craving nicotine, stomach problems, headaches and drowsiness. These symptoms must be addressed for most smokers to successfully become non-smokers.  urlLink TNT - The Power Within You  From Raphaela on 2/7/2003 11:41:34 AMStop bemoaning your fate and get wise to yourself. You have only two choices. You can either go higher or lower. You may take to drink or help yourself to a first-class nervous breakdown or wander around through the rest of your life, moaning about \"what might have been\" if you had only lived your life differently - but telling yourself \"it\\'s too late now\".  But if you belong to that smaller percentage of men and women who have \"gotten wise to themselves\", you discover that it is never too late to get on the right track. You discover that you have been passing up the most wonderful force in your life, the creative power within, which has been ready and willing, at all times, to serve you.  A deep feeling of humility steals over you, and you lose your falsely assumed attitudes of egoism and self-importance forever. Once you are down to bedrock, you find that you have a foundation on which to build, that you can pick up your life again and make something of it, something finer than ever before, perhaps not so flashy or so gaudy, but so much more worthwhile, satisfying, healthful and enjoyable. Now, at last, you can decide what is best for you, without worrying about what the other fellow is going to do to you unless, perhaps, you do it to him first. There has come to you the inner assurance that whatever you need can and will be supplied to you by your creative power, if you keep in attunement with it, and direct it by right mental picturing.

Bush (news - web sites)\\'s spokesman, Ari Fleischer (news - web sites), said he did not have the details.Asked about the contracting process, Fleischer told a news conference: \"The question that people want to be answered is we have a plan in place to put out the oil fires. Refer your question to the agencies involved. I am not familiar with the details of this contract.\"In a statement late Monday, the Defense Department said the Army Corps of Engineers would rely largely on contractors to extinguish the oil well fires and assess the damage to facilities.Kellogg, Brown and Root was the prime contractor for the initial phase, Pentagon said. The contract would be in force for an interim period, until additional contracts were procured, it said.\"We have surveyed these wells and are preparing to mobilize the equipment,\" Boots and Coots president Brian Krause said in a statement.\"We will begin stabilization of the wells once the location around the wells is secure,\" he said.Boots and Coots was brought into Kuwait in 1991 to control about 240 of more than 700 burning wells following the Gulf War (news - web sites), it said.Cheney was chief executive of the KBR parent company Halliburton, a major oil services company, for five years until 2000.urlLink PERSONAL MINISTRY: Advancing God\\'s Kingdom  TOOLS OF THE TRADE Message # 4: (Selected Scriptures) Taught by Dr. Larry Osborne North Coast Church January 30  31, 1999  As in all families, joining God\\'s family brings with it certain responsibilities.

VoyeurismurlLink War in the digital age: Did you see that?  by Francis TillDigital technology is bringing the war to the world in new, sometimes astonishingly immediate ways -- and the development is not always welcome.  Anyone caught without a television, for example, can watch a free, live webcast of downtown Bagdhad on a computer screen, 24/7, courtesy BBC News. That link works on internet-capable PDAs, by the way, which can hook up to wireless nets and provide broadband streams to anyone in an 802.11x cloud, even over coffee in a Starbucks anywhere.  Very early monday morning, that camera was trained on a bank of the Tigris river as Iraqi soldiers and police combed the reeds on the shore in search of what was later reported to be two downed American pilots.  The soldiers fired their automatic weapons into the river, violating whatever passes these days for the rules of handling capture, small boats flitted about in the water, angry crowds gathered on the bridge and along the river road.The audio feed from the camera, which is adequate for loud sounds like traffic and bombs, caught the excited voices of the crowd and even some of the gunfire.  Al Jazeera cameramen were with the soldiers and moments after the webstream fed the images into computers all over the world, very similar pictures began to bloom on television as the Qatar-based station put its images up to satellites.  On BBC webstream 4, the talking heads in the newsroom were taking in the story and beginning to put it out to their global audience. BBC\\'s webstream 4 is a duplicate feed of the news channel\\'s broadcast, with slight variations: at times, it shows presenters during broadcast breaks, for example.  According to the presenters, RAF sources said they could account for all their flights and none were missing. Within 10 minutes, they had quotes from senior officials at the Pentagon making similar statements about American aircraft. Yet, clearly, something was taking place on the banks of the Tigris, where some of the gathered crowd had begun tossing torches into the reeds, hoping to burn the hiding airmen out.  Al Jazeera reported on television at that point that one American pilot had been captured and the crowd was searching for a second airman. According to Al Jazeera, both airmen had been seen parachuting into the river after their airplane had been shot down. Al Jazeera did not use modifiers.  Sky news, at that point, began inserting tag frames onto a picture of the search that quoted US Central Command saying that no coalition planes had been shot down.  On the webstream feed, the sky over Bagdhad began to show as a kind of eerie charcoal grey due to the plumes from burning oil pits, lit earlier in the day in a futile attempt to mask targets from the war planes and missiles.  Meanwhile, the webcam broadcast the sounds of an incoming air attack. Hours before, webcams and television cameras had streamed out images of long range bombers leaving remote bases. Now, they were quite possibly arriving over their target. A target full of civilians, exposed and too far away from shelters to reach what passes for safety in Bagdhad today.  As the crowd began to break up, heading for cover, word came over Sky News from American Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that, indeed, a UK warplane, with two pilots, was missing. Not the Tornado shot down earlier by an American Patriot missile, but another.  But then, it was revealed, he was speaking in only general terms, without specific knowlege.  And finally, an astute BBC reporter pointed out that many things -- bombs, equipment -- came down from airplanes in parachutes. Which might explain the conspicuous absence of a crashed airplane.  BBC World News, unfortunately anchored at that mid-afternoon (London time) hour by an earnest second-stringer, reported it by saying that Rumsfeld had said American soldiers were missing and that an \"allied aircraft\" was missing. BBC\\'s on-the-scene reporter had a firmer grasp of events, reminding the somewhat febrile broadcaster of what had been said in Washington only moments before.  To no avail -- because no matter how good the technology becomes, users will absorb only what they are willing to take in.  In America, England, Australia -- the countries flying planes into danger -- families would have been watching the screens of televisions and computers with dread. They were taking everything in, according to the raw testimony of Nancy Chamberlin, the wife of a fallen Marine, who had told NBC anchor Tom Browkaw a day before that she deeply admired what \"all of the new technology is doing today to bring it (the war) into our homes. But for the mothers and the wives who are out there watching it is murder. It\\'s heartbreak. We can\\'t leave the television. Every tank, every helicopter. Is that my son?\" After she hung up the phone, Brokaw broke up on the air. \"War is not about technology,\" he said. \"Behind everyone one of those computer graphics, there is a life at risk,\" LostRemote reported.  And, indeed, as the bombers drew closer to Bagdhad, authorities there admitted there were no captured pilots. And, perhaps, no plane shot down at all.  It\\'s difficult to lie when the cameras are on.  And the cameras are always on, these days.  Even at 50 miles-per-hour.  Spectacular footage from NBC reporter David Bloom, that has become a staple of the audience devoting its share to that network, is being made possible by a truck-sized transmision platform that keeps honed in on satellites even while rampaging across difficult terrain. The equipment is from Maritime Telecommunications Network (MTN), of Miramar, Florida, and the broadcasts must be seen to be believed.  But even though it is ALL digital, it\\'s not all cameras.  The websites of Iraqi national television, the state news agency and the government were all still online Friday, although working poorly under what internet analysts said are huge surges in traffic. The websites appear to have been abandoned, for the most part, however, with out of date information and broken links to live feeds. By Sunday night, it was almost impossible to reach any of the Uruklink sites, and while the Iraq television spash page was easily accessible, its link to \"live coverage\" was broken.  The Iraqi News Agency site, part of the Uruklink system, has been in trouble for some time, if links are to be believed. It contains an outdated link to the former website of the Iraq Satellite Channel (www.iraqtv.ws) which has since been taken over by what appears to be a Christian expatriate group dedicated to the overthrow of the regime.  According to Brian McWilliams of pc-radio.com, \"Web surfers have encountered intermittent problems reaching Uruklink.net, the Iraq government\\'s main website, after the US launched its initial attack Wednesday night. But those access difficulties were apparently due to a surge of Internet visitors rather than to damage from the bombing.  \"In fact, traffic to Uruklink.net is hitting record levels, according to counters at the site. The homepage of Uruklink.net had over 10,000 visits yesterday, and is on pace to hit 14,000 today. That would represent the busiest day at the site since the counter was installed in December. The previous traffic record occurred on Feb. 9, when the site\\'s address was published in the Drudge Report.\"  McWilliams told Politech, a web-based newsgroup run by journalist Declan McCullagh, that the main Iraqi internet sites may only be visible to visitors from outside the country, but that the country\\'s two mail servers were still operational and responding to ping inquiries.

And with trust, something immense opens up. Then this life is no longer ordinary life, it becomes full of God, overflowing.When the heart is innocent and the walls have disappeared, you are bridged with infinity. And you are not deceived; there is nothing that can be taken away from you. That which can be taken away from you is not worth keeping, and that which cannot be taken away from you... why should one be afraid of its being taken away? It cannot be taken away, there is no possibility. You cannot lose your real treasure.

And it is this quality of absolute trust, with no reservations or secret safety nets, that the Knight of Water demands from us.There is a tremendous sense of exhilaration if we can take the jump and move into the unknown, even if the idea scares us to death. And when we take trust to the level of the quantum leap, we don\\'t make any elaborate plans or preparations. We don\\'t say, \"Okay, I trust that I know what to do now, and I\\'ll settle my things and pack my suitcase and take it with me.\" No, we just jump, with hardly a thought for what happens next.

Ripeness  Only if your meditation has brought you a light that shines in every night will even death not be a death to you but a door to the divine. With the light in your heart, death itself is transformed into a door, and you enter into the universal spirit; you become one with the ocean. And unless you know the oceanic experience, you have lived in vain. Now is always the time, and the fruit is always ripe. You just need to gather courage to enter into your inner forest. The fruit is always ripe and the time is always the right time. There is no such thing as wrong time.  Osho A Sudden Clash of Thunder Chapter 6  Commentary:  When the fruit is ripe, it drops from the tree by itself. One moment it hangs by a thread from the branches of the tree, bursting with juice. The next moment it falls--not because it has been forced to fall, or has made the effort to jump, but because the tree has recognized its ripeness and simply let it go. When this card appears in a reading it indicates that you are ready to share your inner riches, your \\'juice\\'. All you need to do is relax right where you are, and be willing for it to happen. This sharing of yourself, this expression of your creativity, can come in many ways--in your work, your relationships, your everyday life experiences. No special preparation or effort on your part is required. It is simply the right time.  urlLink Yahoo!

Listening means passivity. Listening means forgetting yourself completely - only then can you listen.When you listen attentively to somebody, you forget yourself. If you cannot forget yourself, you never listen. If you are too self-conscious about yourself, you simply pretend that you are listening - you don\\'t listen. You may nod your head; you may sometimes say yes and no, but you are not listening.When you listen, you become just a passage, a passivity, a receptivity, a womb: you become feminine. And to arrive one has to become feminine. You cannot reach God as aggressive invaders, conquerors. You can reach God only...or it will be better to say God can reach you only when you are receptive, a feminine receptivity. When you become yin, a receptivity, the door is open - and you wait. Listening is the art for becoming passive.  Osho A Sudden Clash of Thunder Chapter 5  Commentary:  Receptivity represents the feminine, receptive quality of water and of the emotions. Her arms are extended upwards to receive, and she is completely immersed in the water. She has no head, no busy and aggressive mind to hinder her pure receptivity. And as she is filled she is continuously emptying herself, overflowing, and receiving more. The lotus pattern or matrix that emerges from her represents the perfect harmony of the universe that becomes apparent when we are in tune with it.The Queen of Water brings a time of unboundedness and gratitude for whatever life brings, without any expectations or demands.

Satellite dishes were banned, and cable television was prohibitively expensive. The sole windows to the outside world were radio stations like the BBC, Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo, and the U.S. government\\'s SAWA Radio.Since the regime was overthrown in early April, a throng of freewheeling newspapers, radio and television stations have sprung up to replace the turgid, sycophantic media under Saddam. In the days immediately following the dictatorship\\'s collapse, the country was left without any newspapers. State-run television and radio stations went off the air.The vacuum was quickly filled by papers published by anti-Saddam groups in northern Iraq\\'s Kurdish areas, such as al-Itihad (\"Union\") and Nidaa al-Mustaqbal (\"Call of the Future\"), which made their way to Baghdad. The London-based Arabic-language newspaper al-Hayat became the first foreign daily to be sold in the country on April 17.Within days, new newspapers began appearing on the streets. Three independent radio stations and several local television stations went on the air.\"It is still too early to speak about the freedom of the press,\" said Ali Abdel-Amir, senior editor of Nidaa al-Mustaqbal, a newspaper of the Iraqi National Accord, a longtime umbrella organization for Iraqi opposition groups.\"There is anarchy now,\" Abdel-Amir said. \"Many of these people working in the press are not professional or objective.\"The U.S.-led military coalition that occupied the country has two radio networks of its own, one run by former employees of station previously owned by Saddam\\'s elder son, Odai. Information Radio features news announcements, Arabic music and even Western music like the occasional rendition of \"The Power of Love\" by Huey Lewis and the News.Another station, Radio of the Iraqi Republic, run by former Information Ministry officials, urges listeners to forget the past and work together for a better future.In Baghdad, viewers can tune into the coalition information channel or watch channels from neighboring Iran, primarily the Arabic-language Al-Aalam.Ali al-Fatlawi, a reporter who worked previously for government newspapers, says working for Assaah is much better.\"There is more freedom and more openness,\" he said. \"The red lines have been lifted, and we can express ourselves freely and without threats.\"urlLink News - US post-war effort seen as on the brink of \"fiasco\"  \"It\\'s close to a fiasco,\" said Loren Thompson, an analyst with the Lexington Institute, a Washington research organization.\"The contrasts between the efforts to rebuild Iraq and the stunning military victory could hardly be more pronounced.\"Rejecting criticism that the United States failed to prepare for the post-war occupation, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has suggested that no plan could have anticipated the conditions confronting US forces.\"You couldn\\'t know how it would end,\" Rumsfeld said in an interview with The New York Times published Sunday.urlLink Transom Tools : Sound Equipment Needed  urlLink Ira Glass on making radio : Recommended reading if you want to get on This American Life.

Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress and a great favorite of the Pentagon, warned his detractors that he had acquired about 60 tons of documents from the files of the Iraqi secret police and the Baath Party, and that the documents detailed Saddam Hussein\\'s relations with other Arab leaders. He also threatened to shut down Al Jazeera and accused the television station\\'s journalists of having been informants for the Iraqi government. \"We will not allow this channel to continue its destructive work, which might lead to civil war in Iraq through their lies and the spreading of rumors, because rumors,\" Chalabi said, \"are worse than killing.\" President Bush continued to maintain that \"Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction\" even as high-ranking administration officials said that they would be \"amazed\" if such weapons were found. Other officials suggested that actual illegal weapons might not be found and said that they were more concerned with proving that there had been a \"capability\" to produce them. Weapons experts working in Iraq claimed that they had found a mobile bioweapons laboratory; other military officials in Iraq were skeptical of the claim, saying the evidence was inconclusive and that no trace of such weapons had been found. \"We came to bear country and we came loaded for bear,\" said one Defense Intelligence Agency official, \"and we found that the bear was not there.\" Iraqi nuclear scientists warned that partially enriched uranium from the Al Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center had been taken by looters. \"I saw empty uranium-oxide barrels lying around,\" one scientist said. \"We saw people using them for milking cows and carrying drinking water.\" People living near giant hog factories in the United States were complaining of neurological damage from hydrogen sulfide gas and other dangerous pollutants produced by vast manure cesspools. The Environmental Protection Agency was planning to give large industrial livestock farms amnesty for violations of the Clean Air Act and other environmental laws. Donald Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, nominated an oilman from New Mexico to be secretary of the Navy. Two American soldiers were shot dead in Iraq, and people there continued to complain about the ongoing chaos and violence of the occupation. Doctors at Baghdad\\'s Al Rashad state mental hospital said that American soldiers had knocked down their walls with tanks and then did nothing as the hospital was looted. The sole remaining patient, an insane killer named Ali Sabah, explained that he had stayed because \"I hate the world and the world hates me.

A German diplomat charged that the United States is turning into a police state. The National Archives announced that it was giving up its attempt to recover the famous 18-and-a-half-minute gap in President Richard Nixon\\'s White House tapes. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy testified at his own bribery trial; he complained in an interview that he hadn\\'t been to his house in Bermuda in three years, and said that he was the only man who could save Italy from Communism. \"How much longer,\" he asked, \"do I have to keep living this life of sacrifices?\" A one-year-old boy was shot dead by Israeli soldiers as he played outside his home in the Gaza Strip. Israel was cracking down on human-rights activists, and it began to require all foreigners entering the Gaza Strip, including United Nations relief workers, to sign a waiver stating that they will not hold the Israeli army responsible if it injures or kills them.

Even so, women are leaving corporate America at twice the rate of men.  Why are they leaving and where are they going?  Many are leaving because they are fed up with the obstacles thrown in their path solely due to their gender.  Many have seen their careers make slower progress than their male colleagues, not due to their competence but due to what has been coined as the glass ceiling.  Many need and want more autonomy and flexibility that corporate America is not willing to give.  Many simply want to be their own boss and do for themselves what they have been doing for their employers.  For all these reasons and more, large numbers of women are leaving high paying and challenging jobs to start their own businesses.  A majority of these organizations are wildly successful.  Women-owned businesses are growing more rapidly than the overall economy and becoming major contributors to the U.S. overall economic health and competitiveness. Why Are Women Leaving? Even though women are making inroads into the executive suites of corporations, they are moving at a snail\\x92s pace.  The glass ceiling is still firmly in existence and holding many women back.  Thus, the first logical hypothesis would be that women are leaving to start their own companies because they have run into too many roadblocks at their current institutions.  In fact, the glass ceiling was the highest ranked reason given by a survey of women entrepreneurs (23% of respondents) (Moore and Buttner 1997).  In addition, an almost equal number of women (21%) stated that creating a work environment more consistent with their values was the main reason they started their own company.  In a different study by Catalyst, the highest ranked reasons women gave for leaving a company were lack of flexibility (51%), the glass ceiling (29%), unhappiness with the work environment (28%), and feeling unchallenged in their job (22%) (Catalyst 1998).  This suggests that women are being driven from traditional corporations due to blockades to career advancement and poor work environments.  This further suggests that these entrepreneurs are not only driven by a desire to create a viable business but to be able to make a difference in their company\\x92s direction and to integrate their work into their lifestyle, in other words, job autonomy, freedom, and flexibility.  In many cases, women feel they need meaningful work in order to have a fulfilling and meaningful life.  This cannot be accomplished if they are expected to fit into a niche and morph themselves into a corporate identity. Another factor is many women feel they are undervalued.  In fact, pay equity is still a problem.  In the year 2000, women made 87 cents to every dollar a man made (Chao 2001).  More specifically, in the year 2000 women technicians earn 81.2%, computer programmers 89.6%, engineers 84.3%, mathematical and computer scientists 85.4%, and natural scientists 72.1% of what their male counterparts earn (USDoL 2001).  Another interesting statistic is married women with children (less than 18 years old) make 96.2% of their female counterparts who do not have children.  However there is virtually no difference in pay (99.3%) between married men with children and married men with no children.  This discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that mothers still take on a larger burden of care for their children than the fathers and this affects their careers.  To counteract this problem, women need support and flexibility for balancing work and family so they can be 100% productive in both.  Many view this support as something the company should provide.  When the company does not come through, women perceive this as a key contributor to a poor working environment and opt to start their own business where they have more control over such factors.  How Can Corporations Reverse This Trend? In today\\x92s knowledge based economy the loss of high-level women in corporations is a loss in intellectual capital, knowledge, and connections.  The loss of good people also precipitates low morale and uncertainty among the staff and incurs the cost of recruiting, hiring, and training replacements.  All of this can be avoided in many cases through low cost and innovative programs and changes to the work culture and environment (Donahue 1998). A corporation\\x92s first step is to determine why women are leaving their company in particular.  This could involve obtaining feedback from the employees through interviews or surveys (with a guarantee of confidentiality) and directed questions in exit interviews.  Statistics must be gathered to understand the extent of the problem.  These could include the numbers of women and men entering and leaving the company at different levels, the promotion rate for women and men, the percentage of women in higher management position and where those positions are located (e.g., engineering vs. human resources), and relative salaries grouped by experience, reviews, responsibilities, and other criteria.  Gender inequity issues should be openly discussed without fear of repercussion.  In particular, discussions could center around whether the performance standards are objective and appropriate, whether women are visible enough (or at all) in highly respected positions, the identification of male only traditions, and how mentoring is and should be conducted within the company. It is only when the key problem areas are identified that initial steps can be taken to correct them.  Based on this \\x93research\\x94, goals and solutions to these problems must be formulated and mapped out and then finally implemented.  It is crucial that the company, all the way up to the executive office, is fully supportive of this effort.  Managers must be held responsible for implementing the procedures and meeting the defined goals for gender equity. Some example activities are: being proactive in identifying high potential women and providing mentoring and support for their upward career movement; making the higher ranking women more visible to the rest of the company; ensuring job searches include qualified women candidates; and providing flexibility in the workplace through flextime, onsite or supported childcare, and telecommuting.Women tend to learn more from other people in the company than their male counterparts (Van Velsor and Hughes 1990).  Thus, mentoring and executive development are crucial for the upward movement and retention of women in the organization.  Another key factor that professional women state over and over again for leaving a company is they felt underutilized and undervalued.  This is in large part due to the necessity of constantly proving their competence because they are different from the one good model (i.e., male).  Other models that fit women management styles should be accepted and encouraged throughout the corporation. Essentially the bottom line is: why should women devote all their efforts to fit into an unfriendly culture when they can leave and start their own business?  If business organizations are genuinely concerned about this loss of talent, they must immediately start making changes to their culture and be proactive about the recruitment and retention of women.  Given the move towards a global economy and need for more diversity, corporations cannot afford to ignore the large pool of talented professional women.  Characteristics and Culture of Women Owned Businesses Starting a company is a difficult road, fraught with hurdles, setbacks, and barriers.  However, the professional women who are starting their own businesses are finding that they enjoy the empowerment, excitement, and flexibility.  They are doing things their way, implementing their ideas and management styles. For high tech businesses, the majority of women-owned firms are in the biotechnology industry (46%) with 29% in information technology.  Just the opposite is true for men with 47% in information technology and 33% in biotechnology (NFWBO 2001b).  This follows current trends in bachelor degree awards in the U.S.  The most recent statistics from the Department of Education show women graduates at 58.3% of B.S. graduates in biological and life sciences and only 28.1% in computer and information science (NCES 2001).No matter what the business area is, women bring a different management style and culture to the table.  NFWBO found that 53% of women business owners emphasize \\x93right-brain\\x94 thinking (creativity and values-based decision making), while the majority of male business owners (71%) stress left-brain thinking such as methodological and procedural analysis (NFWBO 1994).  The same study found that two-thirds of women business owners tended to weigh options and reflect internally before decision making more so than their male counterparts (66% vs. 56%), who tended to emphasize action and give more attention to external events. The attributes of a company\\x92s leadership have a strong effect on the culture of the workplace.  Women entrepreneurs are more likely to describe their workplace in \\x93family\\x94 terms and work within a network of business relationships.  Men entrepreneurs, on the other hand, tend to think more in hierarchical terms and focus on establishing clear rules and procedures (NFWBO 1994; Gürer 2001).  The NFWBO study also found that in addition to monetary gain, women tend to derive success from building relationships with customers and employees and having control over their own destiny.  Men on the other hand, derive success from the satisfaction of a job well done and achieving desired goals.  Thus, women\\x92s leadership approaches are more likely to bring about an environment that is a \\x93web of inclusion\\x94 (see Gürer 2001; Helgesen 1995), while men\\x92s leadership is more likely to encourage hierarchical organizations with a top down approach.Another characteristic of women owned businesses is that they are more likely to offer environments that help provide balance in their employees\\x92 lives through programs such as flextime, tuition reimbursement, and job sharing.  Only 30% of small businesses (less than 25 employees) offer flextime, while 40% of women owned small businesses do.  For large businesses (greater than 25 employees), 40% of women-owned firms provide flextime as compared to only 19% of all large firms (NFWBO 1994).  In addition, 21% of women-owned small businesses offer tuition reimbursement programs, as compared to only 8% of all small businesses. Diversity is another factor that can be affected by company leadership.  Not surprisingly, women-owned firms tend to employ a more gender-balanced workforce.  Women-owned businesses employ half women and half men (52% women and 48% men).  Men-owned firms, on the other hand, employ only 38% women and 62% men (NFWBO 2000a). The Success of Women-Owned Businesses From an economic viewpoint, women owned businesses are quite successful.  In 1999, women-owned businesses numbered at 9.1 million, employed over 27.5 million people, and generated over $3.6 trillion in sales (NFWBO 1999).  Of these businesses established in the last decade, the average earns $500,000 or more in revenue.  These businesses are also financially stable.  Women owned firms are as likely to pay bills on time and are as financially sound as all U.S. firms (CWBR 1995).  Businesses owned by women are the most rapidly expanding sector of the economy.  The growth in the number of women-owned firms, employment, and revenue exceeded the rate of growth of all businesses in 1997 (USCB 1997).  From 1987 to 1999, the number of women-owned firms increased by 103%, employment grew by 320%, and sales shot up by 436%.  With respect to high tech firms, a higher percentage of women-owned high tech firms are fast growing than men-owned firms, 48% vs. 28% (NFWBO 2001a), although women-owned firms are in the minority in the high tech sector. Still Some Difficulties Even though women-owned firms on average are very successful, there are still obstacles faced due to gender.  One key difficulty is most women owners of fast-growth firms are less likely to have entrepreneurial mentors or role models, past experience in owning a business, or an executive professional background.  These are all crucial in assisting the entrepreneur along the path of success. Women entrepreneurs of fast growth firms have to depend more on personal debt and business earnings for financing than their male colleagues.  Only 39% of women-owned firms have a commercial bank loan vs. 52% of men-owned firms.  In addition, equity capital for women-owned businesses typically comes from informal investors such as family members and individual \\x93angel\\x94 investors (73%) with only 15% from venture capital firms (NFWBO 2000b).  Women owners of fast-growth firms are also less likely to share ownership of their firms with outside investors (28% for women vs. 49% for men) (NFWBO 2001b).  This reliance on personal and informal debt is holding women-owned firms back since high growth depends in large part to being able to leverage debt and equity. Given these factors, it is crucial that women are given access to entrepreneurship information and mentoring in order to succeed.  There are currently programs that strive towards these goals \\x96 many of which can be linked to via the Center for Women\\'s Business Research\\x92s website at http://www.nfwbo.org  Catalyst for Change? The management style, work culture, and employee benefits offered by women-owned companies not only provide for powerful economic forces, but are influential social forces as well.  Interestingly, the concerns of women in the workplace are also starting to apply to men as well.  A recent survey of technology professionals by Webgrrls, in western New York, found that both men and women were experiencing an imbalance between their work and home life (38% of respondents) (Drury 2001).  Men are now beginning to demand more of a balance between their personal and work life.  In addition, men are taking more of a role in raising their children and other nontraditional male at-home responsibilities.  It is now possible to find stay-at-home dads where the mom is the sole source of income for the family.  However, it is still the majority of women who are concerned with work/life balance and quality of work environments.  The Webgrrls survey found 76% of women feel their work environment is very important versus 51% of men.  Even so, there is a substantial number of men who are starting to realize they want to spend more time outside of work and that a pleasant productive work environment is important.  As the workforce and business leadership become more diverse and markets become more global, the workplace culture is slowly evolving.  The tides of change are coming for more flexible and family or people-friendly workplaces.  Regardless of the effect on workplace environments, it is clear that more and more businesses are being created and run by women.  These businesses are largely successful and it is not too wild of a speculation to state that the women-owned businesses of today will become the Fortune 500 companies of the future.

Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye.In North America, the moon will remain totally eclipsed for 53 minutes, and should turn substantially darker and reddish in color.The total eclipse will start at 8:13 PDT in Los Angeles, 11:13 p.m. EDT in New York. A second lunar eclipse, on Nov. 8, will be visible from North and South America.Eclipses once helped prove the Earth is round, because its shadow on the moon is curved.urlLink Online Audio and Video Recordings: UC Berkeley Lectures and Events  Shining true being: Meditation for the Dying  Imagine that your body no longer has the strength, the energy, to maintain its connection with the life-force, with the body of awareness within. And imagine now that you are beginning to experience the process of dissolving out of that body. Sensations from the body no longer so distinct, melting away, leaving just a spaciousness. Dissolving out of the body. Leaving that heavier form behind. Dissolving into consciousness itself.  My friend, listen now, for that which is called death has arrived. So let go gently, gently, of all that holds you back. Of all that pulls you away from this most precious moment. Know that now you have arrived at the transition called death. Open to it. Let go into it.Recognise the changing experience of the mind as it separates from the body, dissolving.Dissolving now into the realms of pure light. Your true nature shining everywhere before you.My friend, maintain an open-heartedness, a spaciousness of being that does not grasp. Let things be as they are without the least attempt to interfere. Grasping at nothing.Enter the essential nature of your own being shining there before you, a great luminosity. Rest in being. Knowing it for what it is. This light shining, luminous. Your true self.Let go, gently, gently, without the least force. Before you shines your true being. It is without birth, without death.Let go of all which distracts or confuses the mind, all that created density in life.Go gently into it. Do not be frightened or bewildered. Do not pull back in fear from the immensity of your true being. Now is a moment for liberation.Know that you are well guided by your compassion and love. You are the essence of all things. You are the light.From \\'Who Dies?\\' by Stephen Levine. For Each of You  Be who you are and will be learn to cherish that boistrous Black Angel that drives you up one day and down another protecting the place where your power rises running like hot blood from the same source as your pain.  When you are hungry learn to eat whatever sustains you until morning but do not be misled by details simply because you live them.  Do not let your head deny your hands any memory of what passes through them nor your eyes nor your heart everything can be useful except what is wasteful (you will need  to remember this when you are accused of destruction.) Even when they are dangerous examine the heart of those machines you hate before you discard them and never mourn the lack of their power lest you be condemned to relive them. If you do not learn to hate you will never be lonely  enough to love easily nor will you always be brave although it does not grow any easier  Do not pretend to convenient beliefs even when they are righteous you will never be able to defend your city while shouting.  Remember our sun is not the most noteworthy star only the nearest.  Respect whatever pain you bring back from your dreaming but do not look for new gods in the sea nor in any part of a rainbow Each time you love love as deeply as if it were  forever only nothing is  eternal.  Speak proudly to your children where ever you may find them tell them you are the offspring of slaves and your mother was a princess in darkness.  - Audre Lorde in From a Land Where Other People Live  urlLink BBCThinker Quiz  -  I am a mix of the two Existential thinkers:Like to spend time thinking about philosophical issues such as \"What is the meaning of life?\" Try to see beyond the \\'here and now\\', and understand deeper meanings consider moral and ethical implications of problems as well as practical solutions  Like existential thinkers, Leonardo questioned man\\'s role in the universe.

The material, only as thick as three human hairs, displays black text on a whitish-gray background with a resolution similar to that of a typical laptop computer screen.  The screen is so flexible it can be rolled into a cylinder about a half-inch wide without losing its image quality.  Although it\\'s not quite the dream of single-sheet, electronic newspapers or books that can display hundreds of pages of text, its creators said it\\'s the first flexible computer screen of its kind.  ``I think it\\'s a major step forward. We have cleared a big obstacle in electronic paper development,\\'\\' said Yu Chen, a research scientist with E Ink Corp. of Cambridge, Mass.  E Ink is one of several companies working to develop electronic ``paper\\'\\' for e-newspapers and e-books, and other possible applications -- even clothing with computer screens sewn into it.  The new screen is described in Thursday\\'s issue of the journal Nature.  Aris Silzars, the past president of the San Jose, Calif.-based Society for Information Display, said one of the technology\\'s first applications could be something like an electronic tablet lawyers could use in place of bulky laptops.  But Silzars said the best uses of the new screen, which E Ink is still developing, may not be evident. ``It\\'s very hard to predict where this thing may go,\\'\\' he said.  Chen and his co-workers made the 3-inch wide display screen flexible by developing a stainless steel foil topped with a thin layer of circuits that control an overlying film of electronic ink.  That ``ink,\\'\\' developed in 1997 by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist, contains tiny capsules with black and white particles with opposing electrical charges floating in a clear fluid.  When a negative voltage is run through circuits behind these capsules, the positive white particles move to the capsule\\'s top. A positive current does the same to the negative black particles.  The human eye blends these resulting patterns of black- or white-topped capsules into text displayed in a traditional column.  Currently, information and power is fed to the screen through a wired hookup. But Chen\\'s team is working on a self-contained system that could receive data through a wireless connection.  They also hope to boost the speed at which the screen switches to a new ``page\\'\\' of text, from the current quarter of a second to at least 10 times as fast, so it can display video.  Another goal is making the screen display a full range of colors.  Robert Wisnieff, senior manager of IBM Corp.\\'s Advanced Display Technology Laboratory in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., said E Ink\\'s flexible screen is something many futurists believe is crucial to making electronic screens part of every day life.  He envisions such lightweight, thin screens being used for a credit card that could display the available balance or recent purchases.  Another possible use is a jacket with a screen sewn into its sleeve to allow its wearer to read e-mail while on the run, check stock prices or access maps in an unfamiliar city.  ``This is a peek at the future,\\'\\' Wisnieff said.

Truth is functioning through you. When you open your eyes, it is truth opening his eyes. When you close your eyes, it is truth who is closing its eyes.This is a tremendous meditation. If you can simply understand the device, you don\\'t have to do anything; whatever you are doing is being done by truth. You are walking, it is truth; you are sleeping, it is truth resting; you are speaking, it is truth speaking; you are silent, it is truth that is silent.This is one of the most simple meditation techniques. Slowly, slowly everything settles by this simple formula, and then there is no need for the technique. When you are cured, you throw away the meditation, you throw away the medicine. Then you live as truth - alive, radiant, contented, blissful, a song unto yourself. Your whole life becomes a prayer without any words, or better to say a prayerfulness, a grace, a beauty which does not belong to our mundane world, a ray of light coming from the beyond into the darkness of our world.  Osho The Great Zen Master Ta Hui Chapter 23  Commentary:  The Inner Voice speaks not in words but in the wordless language of the heart. It is like an oracle who only speaks the truth. If it had a face, it would be like the face at the center of this card - alert, watchful, and able to accept both the dark and the light, symbolized by the two hands holding the crystal. The crystal itself represents the clarity that comes from transcending all dualities.The Inner Voice can also be playful, as it dives deep into the emotions and emerges again to soar towards the sky, like two dolphins dancing in the waters of life. It is connected with the cosmos, through the crescent-moon crown, and the earth, as represented by the green leaves on the figure\\'s kimono.There are times in our lives when too many voices seem to be pulling us this way and that. Our very confusion in such situations is a reminder to seek silence and centering within. Only then are we able to hear our truth.  urlLink Poetry in Motion in Atlanta  Speech to the Young Speech to the Progress-Toward (Among Them Nora and Henry III)  Say to them, say to the down-keepers, the sun-slappers, the self-soilers, the harmony-hushers,  \"Even if you are not ready for day it cannot always be night.\"  You will be right.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons;  They are vexatious to the spirit.If you compare yourself with others you may become vain or bitter,  For always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.Beyond a wholesome discipline be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars.

Fours have a deep and wide range of emotions and trust their subjective experience to make their life-decisions. They are frequently highly esthetic (not in talent, necessarily, but in concern), because they have a highly developed ability to think symbolically. This coupled with their emotional richness cries out for artistic expression.  Fours make a personal statement in many things they do, from the way they dress to their choice of Impressionist paintings. They rather enjoy not being part of the crowd and have a natural sense of aristocracy. Taste, they maintain, is not determined by votes. When they are less healthy, their speech becomes lamentation as they claim their uniqueness because of their suffering. They often develop a spirit of entitlement to compensate for a feeling that somehow they are defective. This defect, paradoxically, is the basis for their claim that they deserve love. They make a claim on their friends\\' love because they have suffered and this suffering has made them more authentic - and so more lovable.

For that, the path of knowledge, the inquiry of the form \"Who am I?\", is the principal means. 1 . Who am I ? The gross body which is composed of the seven humours (dhatus), I am not; the five cognitive sense organs, viz. the senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell, which apprehend their respective objects, viz. sound, touch, colour, taste, and odour, I am not; the five cognitive sense-organs, viz. the organs of speech, locomotion, grasping, excretion, and procreation, which have as their respective functions speaking, moving, grasping, excreting, and enjoying, I am not; the five vital airs, prana, etc., which perform respectively the five functions of in-breathing, etc., I am not; even the mind which thinks, I am not; the nescience too, which is endowed only with the residual impressions of objects, and in which there are no objects and no functioning\\'s, I am not.2. If I am none of these, then who am I? After negating all of the above-mentioned as \\'not this\\', \\'not this\\', that Awareness which alone remains - that I am.3. What is the nature of Awareness? The nature of Awareness is existence-consciousness-bliss4. When will the realization of the Self be gained? When the world which is what-is-seen has been removed, there will be realization of the Self which is the seer.5. Will there not be realization of the Self even while the world is there (taken as real)? There will not be.6. Why? The seer and the object seen are like the rope and the snake. Just as the knowledge of the rope which is the substrate will not arise unless the false knowledge of the illusory serpent goes, so the realization of the Self which is the substrate will not be gained unless the belief that the world is real is removed.7. When will the world which is the object seen be removed? When the mind, which is the cause of all cognition\\'s and of all actions, becomes quiescent, the world will disappear.8. What is the nature of the mind? What is called \\'mind\\' is a wondrous power residing in the Self. It causes all thoughts to arise. Apart from thoughts, there is no such thing as mind. Therefore, thought is the nature of mind. Apart from thoughts, there is no independent entity called the world. In deep sleep there are no thoughts, and there is no world. In the states of waking and dream, there are thoughts, and there is a world also. Just as the spider emits the thread (of the web) out of itself and again withdraws it into itself, likewise the mind projects the world out of itself and again resolves it into itself. When the mind comes out of the Self, the world appears. Therefore, when the world appears (to be real), the Self does not appear; and when the Self appears (shines) the world does not appear. When one persistently inquires into the nature of the mind, the mind will end leaving the Self (as the residue). What is referred to as the Self is the Atman. The mind always exists only in dependence on something gross; it cannot stay alone. It is the mind that is called the subtle body or the soul (jiva).9. What is the path of inquiry for understanding the nature of the mind? That which rises as \\'I\\' in this body is the mind. If one inquires as to where in the body the thought \\'I\\' rises first, one would discover that it rises in the heart. That is the place of the mind\\'s origin. Even if one thinks constantly \\'I\\' \\'I\\', one will be led to that place. Of all the thoughts that arise in the mind, the \\'I\\' thought is the first. It is only after the rise of this that the other thoughts arise. It is after the appearance of the first personal pronoun that the second and third personal pronouns appear; without the first personal pronoun there will not be the second and third.10. How will the mind become quiescent? By the inquiry \\'Who am I?\\'. The thought \\'who am I?\\' will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed. Then, there will arise Self-realization.11. What is the means for constantly holding on to the thought \\'Who am I?\\' When other thoughts arise, one should not pursue them, but should inquire: \\'To whom do they arise?\\' It does not matter how many thoughts arise. As each thought arises, one should inquire with diligence, \"To whom has this thought arisen?\". The answer that would emerge would be \"To me\". Thereupon if one inquires \"Who am I?\", the mind will go back to its source; and the thought that arose will become quiescent. With repeated practice in this manner, the mind will develop the skill to stay in its source. When the mind that is subtle goes out through the brain and the sense-organs, the gross names and forms appear; when it stays in the heart, the names and forms disappear. Not letting the mind go out, but retaining it in the Heart is what is called \"inwardness\" (antar-mukha). Letting the mind go out of the Heart is known as \"externalisation\" (bahir-mukha). Thus, when the mind stays in the Heart, the \\'I\\' which is the source of all thoughts will go, and the Self which ever exists will shine. Whatever one does, one should do without the egoity \"I\". If one acts in that way, all will appear as of the nature of Siva (God).12. Are there no other means for making the mind quiescent? Other than inquiry, there are no adequate means. If through other means it is sought to control the mind, the mind will appear to be controlled, but will again go forth. Through the control of breath also, the mind will become quiescent; but it will be quiescent only so long as the breath remains controlled, and when the breath resumes the mind also will again start moving and will wander as impelled by residual impressions. The source is the same for both mind and breath. Thought, indeed, is the nature of the mind. The thought \"I\" is the first thought of the mind; and that is egoity. It is from that whence egoity originates that breath also originates. Therefore, when the mind becomes quiescent, the breath is controlled, and when the breath is controlled the mind becomes quiescent. But in deep sleep, although the mind becomes quiescent, the breath does not stop. This is because of the will of God, so that the body may be preserved and other people may not be under the impression that it is dead. In the state of waking and in samadhi, when the mind becomes quiescent the breath is controlled. Breath is the gross form of mind. Till the time of death, the mind keeps breath in the body; and when the body dies the mind takes the breath along with it. Therefore, the exercise of breath-control is only an aid for rendering the mind quiescent (manonigraha); it will not destroy the mind (manonasa). Like the practice of breath-control. meditation on the forms of God, repetition of mantras, restriction on food, etc., are but aids for rendering the mind quiescent.Through meditation on the forms of God and through repetition of mantras, the mind becomes one-pointed. The mind will always be wandering. Just as when a chain is given to an elephant to hold in its trunk it will go along grasping the chain and nothing else, so also when the mind is occupied with a name or form it will grasp that alone. When the mind expands in the form of countless thoughts, each thought becomes weak; but as thoughts get resolved the mind becomes one-pointed and strong; for such a mind Self-inquiry will become easy. Of all the restrictive rules, that relating to the taking of sattvic food in moderate quantities is the best; by observing this rule, the sattvic quality of mind will increase, and that will be helpful to Self-inquiry.13. The residual impressions (thoughts) of objects appear wending like the waves of an ocean. When will all of them get destroyed? As the meditation on the Self rises higher and higher, the thoughts will get destroyed.14. Is it possible for the residual impressions of objects that come from beginningless time, as it were, to be resolved, and for one to remain as the pure Self? Without yielding to the doubt \"Is it possible, or not?\", one should persistently hold on to the meditation on the Self. Even if one be a great sinner, one should not worry and weep \"O! I am a sinner, how can I be saved?\"; one should completely renounce the thought \"I am a sinner\"; and concentrate keenly on meditation on the Self; then, one would surely succeed. There are not two minds - one good and the other evil; the mind is only one. It is the residual impressions that are of two kinds - auspicious and inauspicious. When the mind is under the influence of auspicious impressions it is called good; and when it is under the influence of inauspicious impressions it is regarded as evil. The mind should not be allowed to wander towards worldly objects and what concerns other people. However bad other people may be, one should bear no hatred for them. Both desire and hatred should be eschewed. All that one gives to others one gives to one\\'s self. If this truth is understood who will not give to others? When one\\'s self arises all arises; when one\\'s self becomes quiescent all becomes quiescent. To the extent we behave with humility, to that extent there will result good. If the mind is rendered quiescent, one may live anywhere.15. How long should inquiry be practised? As long as there are impressions of objects in the mind, so long the inquiry \"Who am I?\" is required. As thoughts arise they should be destroyed then and there in the very place of their origin, through inquiry. If one resorts to contemplation of the Self unintermittently, until the Self is gained, that alone would do. As long as there are enemies within the fortress, they will continue to sally forth; if they are destroyed as they emerge, the fortress will fall into our hands.16. What is the nature of the Self? What exists in truth is the Self alone. The world, the individual soul, and God are appearances in it. like silver in mother-of-pearl, these three appear at the same time, and disappear at the same time. The Self is that where there is absolutely no \"I\" thought. That is called \"Silence\". The Self itself is the world; the Self itself is \"I\"; the Self itself is God; all is Siva, the Self.17. Is not everything the work of God? Without desire, resolve, or effort, the sun rises; and in its mere presence, the sun-stone emits fire, the lotus blooms, water evaporates; people perform their various functions and then rest. Just as in the presence of the magnet the needle moves, it is by virtue of the mere presence of God that the souls governed by the three (cosmic) functions or the fivefold divine activity perform their actions and then rest, in accordance with their respective karmas. God has no resolve; no karma attaches itself to Him. That is like worldly actions not affecting the sun, or like the merits and demerits of the other four elements not affecting all pervading space.18. Of the devotees, who is the greatest? He who gives himself up to the Self that is God is the most excellent devotee. Giving one\\'s self up to God means remaining constantly in the Self without giving room for the rise of any thoughts other than that of the Self. Whatever burdens are thrown on God, He bears them. Since the supreme power of God makes all things move, why should we, without submitting ourselves to it, constantly worry ourselves with thoughts as to what should be done and how, and what should not be done and how not? We know that the train carries all loads, so after getting on it why should we carry our small luggage on our head to our discomfort, instead of putting it down in the train and feeling at ease?19. What is non-attachment? As thoughts arise, destroying them utterly without any residue in the very place of their origin is non-attachment. Just as the pearl-diver ties a stone to his waist, sinks to the bottom of the sea and there takes the pearls, so each one of us should be endowed with non-attachment, dive within oneself and obtain the Self-Pearl.20. Is it not possible for God and the Guru to effect the release of a soul? God and the Guru will only show the way to release; they will not by themselves take the soul to the state of release. In truth, God and the Guru are not different. Just as the prey which has fallen into the jaws of a tiger has no escape, so those who have come within the ambit of the Guru\\'s gracious look will be saved by the Guru and will not get lost; yet, each one should by his own effort pursue the path shown by God or Guru and gain release. One can know oneself only with one\\'s own eye of knowledge, and not with somebody else\\'s. Does he who is Rama require the help of a mirror to know that he is Rama?21. Is it necessary for one who longs for release to inquire into the nature of categories (tattvas)? Just as one who wants to throw away garbage has no need to analyse it and see what it is, so one who wants to know the Self has no need to count the number of categories or inquire into their characteristics; what he has to do is to reject altogether the categories that hide the Self. The world should be considered like a dream.22. Is there no difference between waking and dream? Waking is long and a dream short; other than this there is no difference. Just as waking happenings seem real while awake. so do those in a dream while dreaming. In dream the mind takes on another body. In both waking and dream states thoughts. names and forms occur simultaneously.23. Is it any use reading books for those who long for release? All the texts say that in order to gain release one should render the mind quiescent; therefore their conclusive teaching is that the mind should be rendered quiescent; once this has been understood there is no need for endless reading. In order to quieten the mind one has only to inquire within oneself what one\\'s Self is; how could this search be done in books? One should know one\\'s Self with one\\'s own eye of wisdom. The Self is within the five sheaths; but books are outside them. Since the Self has to be inquired into by discarding the five sheaths, it is futile to search for it in books. There will come a time when one will have to forget all that one has learned.24. What is happiness? Happiness is the very nature of the Self; happiness and the Self are not different. There is no happiness in any object of the world. We imagine through our ignorance that we derive happiness from objects. When the mind goes out, it experiences misery. In truth, when its desires are fulfilled, it returns to its own place and enjoys the happiness that is the Self. Similarly, in the states of sleep, samadhi and fainting, and when the object desired is obtained or the object disliked is removed, the mind becomes inward-turned, and enjoys pure Self-Happiness. Thus the mind moves without rest alternately going out of the Self and returning to it. Under the tree the shade is pleasant; out in the open the heat is scorching. A person who has been going about in the sun feels cool when he reaches the shade. Someone who keeps on going from the shade into the sun and then back into the shade is a fool. A wise man stays permanently in the shade. Similarly, the mind of the one who knows the truth does not leave Brahman. The mind of the ignorant, on the contrary, revolves in the world, feeling miserable, and for a little time returns to Brahman to experience happiness. In fact, what is called the world is only thought. When the world disappears, i.e. when there is no thought, the mind experiences happiness; and when the world appears, it goes through misery.25. What is wisdom-insight (jnana-drsti)? Remaining quiet is what is called wisdom-insight. To remain quiet is to resolve the mind in the Self. Telepathy, knowing past, present and future happenings and clairvoyance do not constitute wisdom-insight.26. What is the relation between desirelessness and wisdom? Desirelessness is wisdom. The two are not different; they are the same. Desirelessness is refraining from turning the mind towards any object. Wisdom means the appearance of no object. In other words, not seeking what is other than the Self is detachment or desirelessness; not leaving the Self is wisdom.27. What is the difference between inquiry and meditation? Inquiry consists in retaining the mind in the Self. Meditation consists in thinking that one\\'s self is Brahman, existence-consciousness-bliss.28. What is release? Inquiring into the nature of one\\'s self that is in bondage, and realising one\\'s true nature is release.SRI RAMANARPANAM ASTU  Here is your horoscope for Sunday, June 15:  View your situation with clear eyes and a cool head.

Some get jobs as priests\"At most, they can become a teacher in Sanskrit schools, Sanskrit colleges so their salaries are also very meagre.\"\"The other opportunity for them is to perform [religious] rituals for some rich people,\" he added.Lacking relevance?The other reason why Sanskrit is losing out is because it was never really the language of the masses.It was the language of the elite used for correspondence amongst royalty and for composing classic prose and poetry.There are some who opt for Sanskrit because it is regarded as a subject in which one can get high grades and can help improve one\\'s overall grades.But most students learn the language to know about the past. Some study Sanskrit to improve their grades. There is a school of thought which believes that teaching and learning Sanskrit is a complete waste of time and resources, especially as most Sanskrit colleges are publicly funded.Critics of Sanskrit say government-funded colleges should be preparing students for the real world and offer only vocational and employment-oriented courses.However, Sanskrit scholars like Girish Jani rubbish this approach.\"Why should we read Shakespeare? Why should we read Sartre? Are they connected really with the life in the first attempt? No.\"We, at our own level, want to be refined, to be cultured, to be a better person and this is here, we need Sanskrit.\"Scholars like Mr Jani do have a point and there is logic in their argument about Sanskrit being a language of cultural refinement,But the sad reality is that Sanskrit is fighting a losing battle in the country of its origin.urlLink NASA researcher, Rick Briggs has written:\"In ancient India the intention to discover truth was so consuming, that in the process, they discovered perhaps the most perfect tool for fulfilling such a search that the world has ever known -- the Sanskrit language. There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which for the duration of almost 1000 years was a living spoken language with a considerable literature of its own. Besides works of literary value, there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that has continued to exist with undiminished vigor until the present century. Among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence. This article demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial language also, and that much work in AI has been reinventing a wheel millennia old.  The discovery is of monumental significance. It is mind-boggling to consider that we have available to us a language which has been spoken for 4-7000 years that appears to be in every respect a perfect language designed for enlightened communication. But the most stunning aspect of the discovery is this: NASA the most advanced research center in the world for cutting edge technology has discovered that Sanskrit, the world\\'s oldest spiritual language is the only unambiguous spoken language on the planet. Considering Sanskrit\\'s status as a spiritual language, a further implication of this discovery is that the age old dichotomy between religion and science is an entirely unjustified one.  It is also relevant to note that in the last decade physicists have begun to comment on the striking similarities between their own discoveries and the discoveries made thousands of years ago in India which went on to form the basis of most Eastern religions.  Why has Sanskrit endured? Fundamentally it generates clarity and inspiration. And that clarity and inspiration is directly responsible for a brilliance of creative expression such as the world has rarely seen.Another hope for the return of Sanskrit lies in computers. Sanskrit and computers are a perfect fit. The precision play of Sanskrit with computer tools will awaken the capacity in human beings to utilize their innate higher mental faculty with a momentum that would inevitably transform the world. In fact the mere learning of Sanskrit by large numbers of people in itself represents a quantum leap in consciousness, not to mention the rich endowment it will provide in the arena of future communication.\"  (source: Knowledge Representation in Sanskrit and Artificial Intelligence - By Rick Briggs Artificial Intelligence Magazine 6(1) 32-39 1985).  urlLink A Tribute to Hinduism  Lead me from the unreal to the real.Lead me from the darkness to light.

The third center has created the abundance of love. By reaching to the third center in meditation, you have become so overflowing with love, with compassion, and you want to share. It happens at the fourth center, the heart.That\\'s why even in the ordinary world people think love comes out of the heart. For them it is just hearsay, they have heard it; they don\\'t know it because they have never reached to their heart. But the meditator finally reaches to the heart. As he has reached to the center of his being - the third center - suddenly an explosion of love and compassion and joy and blissfulness and benediction has arisen in him with such a force that it hits his heart and opens the heart. The heart is just in the middle of all your seven centers - three centers below, three centers above. You have come exactly to the middle.  Commentary:  The Queen of Fire is so rich, so much a queen, that she can afford to give. It doesn\\'t even occur to her to take inventories or to put something aside for later. She dispenses her treasures without limits, welcoming all and sundry to partake of the abundance, fertility and light that surrounds her.When you draw this card, it suggests that you too are in a situation where you have an opportunity to share your love, your joy and your laughter. And in sharing, you find that you feel even more full.There is no need to go anywhere or to make any special effort. You find that you can enjoy sensuality without possessiveness or attachment, can give birth to a child or to a new project with an equal sense of creativity fulfilled.Everything around you seems to be \"coming together\" now. Enjoy it, ground yourself in it, and let the abundance in you and around you overflow.  urlLink ThunderbirdsurlLink Osho Zen Tarot  - CourageThe seed cannot know what is going to happen, the seed has never known the flower. And the seed cannot even believe that he has the potentiality to become a beautiful flower. Long is the journey, and it is always safer not to go on that journey because unknown is the path, nothing is guaranteed.Nothing can be guaranteed. Thousand and one are the hazards of the journey, many are the pitfalls - and the seed is secure, hidden inside a hard core. But the seed tries, it makes an effort; it drops the hard shell which is its security, it starts moving. Immediately the fight starts: the struggle with the soil, with the stones, with the rocks. And the seed was very hard and the sprout will be very, very soft and dangers will be many.There was no danger for the seed, the seed could have survived for millennia, but for the sprout many are the dangers. But the sprout starts towards the unknown, towards the sun, towards the source of light, not knowing where, not knowing why. Great is the cross to be carried, but a dream possesses the seed and the seed moves.The same is the path for man. It is arduous. Much courage will be needed.  Commentary:  This card shows a small wildflower that has met the challenge of the rocks and stones in its path to emerge into the light of day. Surrounded by an aura of bright golden light, it exposes the majesty of its tiny self. Unashamed, it is equal to the brightest sun.When we are faced with a very difficult situation we have a choice: we can either be resentful, and try to find somebody or something to blame for the hardships, or we can face the challenge and grow.The flower shows us the way, as its passion for life leads it out of the darkness and into the light. There is no point fighting against the challenges of life, or trying to avoid or deny them. They are there, and if the seed is to become the flower we must go through them.

It is not well-understood how a perfectly round star can turn into such an unusual-looking nebula.  {Apply this concept to people.}Planetary nebulae occur in a huge variety of shapes and sizes. They are the final stage of a star\\'s life before it ends its days as a burnt-out white dwarf. When it dies, a star rapidly sheds the outer parts of its atmosphere, creating a planetary nebula that exists only as long as the star has fuel to burn.  {Apply this concept to people.}Stars are large recycling factories. Over their lifetimes of millions of years they process huge amounts of the lighter elements (mostly hydrogen and helium)  {apply this concept to people}  into heavier ones (such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen)  {apply this concept to people} . These heavier elements are then dispersed into the surrounding space when the stars peel off their atmospheres to form planetary nebulae. In turn, the heavier elements may become part of other stars or end up in planetary systems like our own Solar System.

On a recent sunny afternoon, the van held a load of llama manure bound for the vegetable beds at his Beacon Hill home, and a slant-6 engine Jacobs will install in another of his vehicles, a \\'63 Dart. And there was a Toyota engine in there, too. (Jacobs is partial to old Dodges and Toyotas. He also owns a banged-up Toyota pickup he bought for 50 bucks. He replaced the timing chain and has since driven the truck clear across the country.)The van is unusual in that it has double doors on both sides, which makes loading and unloading stuff like llama manure and slant-6 engines a heck of a lot easier. And then there are the unusual duties it has served in its 33 years. One previous owner made modifications to accommodate a wheelchair-using family member. And back when the van was new it was an animal control truck.  \"I don\\'t think they called it that back then,\" Jacobs said. \"I think they called it the dog-catcher van. It was up in the San Juan Islands; I think that\\'s why it has the rust.\"  In the three or four years he has owned it, Jacobs, an auto mechanic by training, has rebuilt the engine and the transmission. \"It was so much work getting it out, I figured I would do it all,\" he said.  \"I\\'m not going to tell you how much money I\\'ve put into it,\" he said, but he did allow that sending the radiator out to be re-cored set him back nearly as much as he paid for the van.  \"I found the van on the Internet,\" Jacobs said. \"This guy wanted $400 for it. The picture looked so good, but when I got there it looked like (bleep!).\" So Jacobs bargained the price down.  \"I paid $300 for the van and $250 to have the radiator rebuilt,\" he said. \"They don\\'t sell these anymore, so I had to have it rebuilt.\" Jacobs, who will turn 34 this year, is thinking of getting out of the wrench-turning trade (\"I don\\'t know if I\\'ll keep doing this kind of work,\" he said), but his skills make feasible owning and operating vehicles as old or older than he is. And while he acknowledges that the van isn\\'t in great shape, he has no interest in parting with it.\"There\\'s no way I could ever sell it and get back what I\\'ve put into it,\" he said.  That rebuilt engine certainly sounds healthy, but Jacobs admits the van doesn\\'t run as well as it could.  \"It would be nice to say that,\" he said. \"It doesn\\'t run perfect, but it gets the job done.\"  urlLink Impossible Dream : To dream the impossible dream To fight the unbeatable foe To bear with unbearable sorrow And to run where  the brave dare not go To right the unrightable wrong And to love pure and chaste from afar To try when your arms are too weary To reach the unreachable star  This is my quest To follow that star No matter how hopeless No matter how far To fight for the right Without question or pause To be willing to march,  march into hell For that heavenly cause And I know If I\\'ll only be true To this glorious quest That my heart Will lie peaceful and calm When I\\'m laid to my rest  And the world will be  better for this That one man, scorned  and covered with scars, Still strove with his last  ounce of courage To reach the unreachable,  the unreachable, The unreachable star And I\\'ll always dream The impossible dream Yes, and I\\'ll reach The unreachable star.

Swimming in a sea of boundless opportunity would soon lead to exhaustion. Winging it alone in a sky of boundless opportunity would lead to being lost. In human affairs, the making of choices, and alliances, implies limitation, for in choosing one path another must be abandoned.  One key to a successful life is to select your limits consciously and carefully - to be discriminating in the setting of personal boundaries and knowing when to join in formation. Thrift, for example, often precedes prosperity; just as the letting go of selfish interests often leads to greater personal reward. Only by consciously accepting useful limits can one\\'s energy be channeled to good purpose, and lead to lasting accomplishment.  Point yourself toward a middle way, the mean between discipline and freedom of spirit. Limits will come of their own accord; but to be able to consciously select your own affiliations in life - that\\'s knowing how to fly! At the same time, do not go overboard on discipline. Even limitation must be limited, so that in attempting to bring order and direction into your life you do not choke off vital sources of enthusiasm and spontaneity.  Similarly, in groups and organizations, the rules and regulations should strike a balance between being too strict and too soft.

Here\\'s what the doctor says I have -  ACUTE BRONCHITIS  Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, or bronchi (the air passages that extend from the windpipe into the lungs). The inflammation may be caused by a virus, bacteria, smoking or the inhalation of chemical pollutants or dust. When the cells of the bronchial-lining tissue are irritated beyond a certain point, the tiny hairs (cilia) within them, which normally trap and eliminate pollutants, stop functioning. Consequently, the air passages become clogged by debris and irritation increases. In response, a heavy secretion of mucus develops, which causes the characteristic cough of bronchitis. Acute bronchitis usually lasts about 10 days. Severe cases may also cause general malaise and chest pain. I\\'m getting ready to quit smoking. I woke up at 5 am with tremendous pain in my lungs.

As another good book puts it, \\'To every thing there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.\\' Like a reservoir that is being used to irrigate the fields, learning to accept a decrease in position or material possessions is part of preparing for increase in the future.  We may live in materialistic times, but there is no disgrace in material decrease, particularly if it represents an investment in future gain - even if that gain be in the form of learning or the development of personal character. Likewise, the inner strength that comes from bearing loss can be balanced by a corresponding increase in inner strength and insight. When letting go of material desires leads to a greater simplicity in daily life, good fortune often comes calling.  In nature, the lake evaporates to form the clouds that drop the rain which nurtures the surrounding forest. As the forest grows thick, more rain is captured for the lake. Similarly, an \\'evaporation\\' or decrease in one area of your life, may give rise to an eventual increase. A loss of responsibility at work can mean more free time; more free time may generate more career options. A decrease in material possessions can free the spirit and fill the soul.  Be mindful of the lesson of young lovers: even with a minimum of possessions, feelings of the heart can bring an unsurpassed richness to life. The smallest of actions, if sincere, have value.

Realization: The Poori Effect: How We Sometimes Fool Ourselves  Just seated in an Indian vegetarian buffet restaurant with a friend, a beaming waitress comes along, \"Poori or nan (traditional flour-based foods)?\" I replied \"Two nans please.\" She remarked enthusiastically, \"Oh, would you like to try the poori?\" \"No.\" She smiled on, \"They are very nice. Have you tried them before? You should try!\" I smiled weakly, \"Okay one poori and one nan.\" I tried poori before, but prefer nan. But she was so unknowingly pushy that I patronised her. She walked by later, saw the empty plate, and asked, once again, beaming happily, \"Was the poori nice?\" My friend smiled sheepishly and gave a weak nod. She too prefers nan. The waitress smiles back, moving off to serve another \"happy\" customer.I call this \"The Poori Effect.\" It is the unmindful shaping of the world according to one\\'s perceptions. The waitress already made up her mind as to what we should try before asking- her favourite. Due to the way she carried herself, we \"naturally obliged\". We were later \"obliged\" to give her a positive response- out of \"courtesy\". The result was a totally deluded idea of our opinion of poori. We might have made her day in the worldly sense, but at the expense of reinforcing her delusion. We sometimes \"unwittingly\" mirror the world - the world smiles and we smile back. But is your smile true? On the other hand, is your smiling \"forcing\" the world to smile back reluctantly or genuinely? We see what we want to see. I know friends who seemingly get along well with others, who ironically talk behind their backs. The Poori Effect is a case of two-way hypocrisy- bad faith. We are at times not mindfully sincere enough to discover how the world truly feels about us and present ourselves in a way that will not receive negative feedback. This is hypocrisy to oneself and others, even though there might be some genuine goodwill within. When we patronise in return, giving positive feedback which is ungenuine, it is hypocrisy too. Either way, anyone being hypocritical is being untrue. Can we learn to speak true and wise words, about what we feel, in a kind way? Even if the truth bites a little, does it matter? Since it is \"sugar-coated\" with kindness, the truth should be more digestible, right? Asking is hypocritical, to oneself and others, if you do so with an answer in mind. Some even cling on to the answer in their mind when they receive an answer they do not like. \"No no, what does he know? Pooris are the best!\" Do you stop to reflect that the world does not have the same perception as you? But what is the truth about preferences and opinions? Preferences are about personal likes and dislikes (feelings that arise from attachment and aversion) that arise with our clouded perception- and the Buddha says that feelings and perceptions are illusory. Because we do not see things as they truly are (have wrong perception), we develop feelings of wanting to hold or reject. Everything changes fleetingly in the moment, some noticeable, some less. Pooris might taste much better if I let go of my aversion? Nans might be just as good to the waitress if she lets go of hers?Let us cultivate a mind with greater equanamity - a calm and balanced mental state uncluttered by likes and dislikes. The more equanimous the mind is, the more sincere one is to oneself and others. When we ask a question for opinion with an equanimous state of mind, we are able to more accurately receive and analyse the answers others give objectively. This is crucial to both worldly and spiritual discernment. Only so can we realise the truth in its entire spectrum, from pooris to nans, to understanding ourselves and the world at large - leading to Enlightenment! -  urlLink shian@TheDailyEnlightenment.com  \"Understanding the way of the world, the sport and play of destiny, the continuity of the waking and dream states, a wise person becomes filled with the extraordinary mystery of the formless, and feels lighthearted with this simple awareness.

On this day, sisters tie sacred threads around their brothers\\' wrists, symbolizing their love and affection. In return, the brother promises to protect his sister and to always be there for her. Rakhsha means protection or security and bandhan means a bond or relation. Thus, Rakhsha Bandhan symbolizes the bond of security and protection between brothers and sisters. However, on Rakhi, the brothers and sisters do not have to be blood relatives. That is the beauty of Indian culture. Our tradition tells us that the world is our brother and sister. As the dawn breaks on the new millennium, we must realize that the only way the world will survive is united as one family. Thus, now, we must also take the deeper, underlying meaning of Rakhi. We must vow to make the world our brothers and sisters not only in theory, but also in practice. Let us use rakhi as a symbol of our universal brotherhood. May our girls and women lead the way toward this universal family as they tie rakhi bracelets on the wrists of not only their closest male friends, but also on the wrists of enemies.

Bush made a televised address to the nation and declared that Iraq was now the \"central front\" in the war on terrorism. He called for national resolve and national sacrifice and said that he will ask Congress for $87 billion in emergency funds for the occupation. It was noted that this new request, which comes on top of $79 billion already approved, will probably push the current budget deficit up to $600 billion. Howard Dean said the speech, which made no mention of Osama bin Laden, was \"outrageous\" and said it reminded him of Lyndon Johnson and the Vietnam War. Senator Bob Graham observed that Bush now wants to spend more on Iraq this year than the federal government will spend on education. Gunmen fired on a Sunni mosque in Baghdad just after morning prayers and injured three people, a car bomb exploded near the headquarters of the Baghdad police department, a British bomb squad expert was killed, an American Humvee was blown up, and Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez said that attacks on American forces were down to about 14 or 15 a day. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was touring Iraq and Afghanistan, complained that the news media was ignoring \"the story of success and accomplishment\" in Iraq. Rumsfeld acknowledged that he still doesn\\'t know who is carrying out the guerrilla attacks but said that the intelligence community is working on it. \"They\\'re not comfortable at the moment with what we don\\'t know.\" A man died and several others were injured while riding Disneyland\\'s Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. The World Council of Churches denounced the invasion of Iraq as \"immoral\" and \"ill advised\" and called for the withdrawal of American forces. A congressional study found that the occupation of Iraq is unsustainable given the current size of the U.S. military, and the United States released a draft resolution calling on the United Nations to create a multinational peacekeeping force for Iraq that would remain under American military and political control. Heavy fighting continued in Afghanistan, and surface-to-air missiles were fired at a transport plane in Baghdad. Donald Rumsfeld, who was nearby, said that such attacks are just a cost of doing business. Rumsfeld claimed that there has been \"breathtaking\" progress in Afghanistan since the war ended. \"I\\'m not being Pollyannaish,\" he said. \"I\\'m telling the truth.\"President Bush, apparently worried about the fact that the American economy has lost almost 3 million jobs since he took office, promised to appoint a \"manufacturing czar\" who will watch out for blue-collar jobs. The Labor Department announced that 93,000 jobs were lost in August, and a new study found that the federal workforce is at its highest level (12.1 million) since the Cold War. The Census Department reported that the number of poor people increased last year by 1.3 million. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a settlement with energy companies that benefited from market manipulation in the California energy crisis two years ago. The companies agreed to pay about $1 million in fines, or about 3 cents for every Californian, though the energy scam cost the state $8.9 billion, or $250 per citizen. The Environmental Protection Agency relaxed restrictions on selling land contaminated with PCBs, and an astronomer argued that Venus once had a climate similar to Earth\\'s, prior to its transformation by the greenhouse effect. A federal appeals court blocked the FCC\\'s new rules expanding the freedom of media monopolies, and Jessica Lynch, the former Army private who was captured by Iraqis and became the subject of an elaborate heroic fiction, signed a book deal and reportedly received a $1 million advance. Lynch will share the advance with her co-author Rick Bragg, a former New York Times reporter.

There were rumors of a coup plot in the Philippines. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt condemned gay marriage. An Israeli commission of inquiry concluded that police used excessive force in putting down a riot by Israeli Arabs three years ago in which 13 people were killed. The commission suggested that the police stop using snipers armed with rubber-coated steel bullets to disperse Arab crowds. Three Israeli F-15 fighter jets piloted by the descendants of Holocaust survivors flew over the Auschwitz death camp in Poland during a memorial service. The Auschwitz Museum had opposed the flyover, saying that a military display was inappropriate on such an occasion. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian prime minister, resigned, and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, was injured in an Israeli airstrike.

Evil need not take extravagant, forms, such as those exhibited in Nazi Germany. Garden-variety lies and deceit are much more common and persistent, but should be rooted out just as diligently. One must be resolved against negativity - whether in one\\'s social or professional life, or in one\\'s own soul. In either case, definite rules must be followed for the struggle to succeed.  The first rule: do not compromise with evil. Negative actions must be identified openly for what they are, and discredited. The second: one cannot resist negativity on its own terms. New, positive alternatives which lead away from the source of the problem are generally more successful, and appropriate, than to counter negativity with raw power.

S. MahawatteAlmost all religions in the world except Buddhism have as their foundation a creator God and an immortal soul. Let us briefly examine the core beliefs of a few of these religions.  The core belief in Hinduism is, after death one joins Paramathma. They are required to have utmost Faith in the Trio- Brahma - (Creator); Vishnu - (Ruler) and Shiva- (Destroyer) of the Universe. To them, Moksya could be achieved only after death. There are other gods such as Ganapathy and Skanda and by having faith in them, they can pray to enable them to find security and lead prosperous lives.  Buddhists, too, visit these Kovils and pray to these Gods seeking mundane help to overcome their various day to day problems. But unlike Hindus, the Buddhists perform meritorious acts and transfer the merit thus acquired, to Gods and seek their help. According to Buddhism Gods are unable to commit meritorious acts by themselves. The Buddha said that people pray out of fear and that fear is due to inability to understand things as they really are. This is due to Avijja - nescience or ignorance and the Buddha has taught his disciples how to develop the Wisdom needed to bring to an end this Avijja.  Almighty God  Christianity which came to be long after Hinduism also believes in an Almighty God as the creator of the universe. They are expected to have complete faith in the Trinity - Father, Son and the Holy Ghost. This appears to have some similarity to the Hindu trio Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Their Mokshya which they believe as joining their soul with the Creator, can be achieved only after death and that too, only with God\\x92s love and repenting for their sins and prayer. They cannot achieve Mokshya by their own efforts.  Islam also requires absolute faith in Almighty Allah and is also based on Atma - Soul and to have utmost faith in the Creator God and to pray daily, so that after death they join their Creator - Mokshya.  The followers of the above religions hold fast to the belief that there is an immortal soul somewhere within them, which they want to continue to exist forever, by joining with their Creator.  Let us now listen to what the Buddha had to say on this subject. A Bhikku once asked the Buddha \\x91Ven. Sir, is there a case where one is tormented when something permanent within oneself is not found\\x92.  The Buddha said \\x91Yes, Bhikku there is. A man has the following view. The Universe is that Atman, I shall be that after death, permanent, abiding, everlasting, unchanging and I shall exist as such for eternity.  \\x91He hears the Thathagatha or a disciple of his, preaching the doctrine aiming at the complete destruction of all speculative views ... aiming at the extinction of \\x91Thirst\\x92 Thanha, aiming at detachment, cessation Nirvana\\x92. Then that man thinks \\x91I will be annihilated, I will be destroyed, I will be no more. So he mourns, worries himself, laments, weeps, beating his breasts and become bewildered. Thus O Bhikku, there is a case where one is tormented when something permanent within oneself is not found\\x92 (from What the Buddha taught by late Dr. Walpola Rahula thera). \"After planting, the seed requires adequate amount of water, fertilizer, sunshine, and air to grow. By having the suitable karmic affinity, the sapling will grow into a healthy tree.\" - Venerable Master Cheng Yen Cancer Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com): You are apt to get the feeling that the grass is greener on the other side today, dear Cancer.

Chapman  Indigo Children are the current generation being born today and most of those who are 8 years old or younger. They are different. They have very unique characteristics that set them apart from previous generations of children. The name itself indicates the Life Color they carry in their auras and is indicative of the Third Eye Chakra, which represents intuition and psychic ability. These are the children who are often rebellious to authority, nonconformist, extremely emotionally and sometimes physically sensitive or fragile, highly talented or academically gifted and often metaphysically gifted as well, usually intuitive, very often labeled ADD, either very empathic and compassionate OR very cold and callous, and are wise beyond their years. Does this sound like yourself or your child?Indigos have come into this world with difficult challenges to overcome. Their extreme levels of sensitivity are hard to understand and appreciate by parents who don\\'t share this trait. Their giftedness is unusual in such high numbers. Their nonconformity to systems and to discipline will make it difficult to get through their childhood years and perhaps even their adult years. It is also what will help them accomplish big goals such as changing the educational system, for instance. Being an Indigo won\\'t be easy for any of them, but it foretells a mission. The Indigo Children are the ones who have come to raise the vibration of our planet! These are the primary ones who will bring us the enlightenment to ascend.There\\'s a very good chance your child is an Indigo if he/she was born after 1992. About 85% or higher of children born in \\'92 or later, 90% born in \\'94 or after and 95% or more born now (some even say 99%) are Indigo Children! Does this mean you aren\\'t one if you were born prior to 1992? No! I\\'ve heard reports that they started coming in the 80s, but that means coming in larger numbers. I believe there have been Indigos born in every year, but perhaps not in high enough percentages to notice their presence and see what makes them so unique. So can you be a 24 yr old Indigo or a 50 year old one? Yes! urlLink NEXT - Is Your Child an Indigo?\"Drop your opinionated mind and move inside.

The move by Washington and Brasilia to a lowest-common-denominator FTAA deal, ridiculed as \\'FTAA lite\\', reflects gaping disagreements between the two economic titans of the Western Hemisphere over how far negotiations should go in dismantling trade barriers.

There have been numerous speculations about what might happen during this time. Some are rather extreme, to say the least. Some expect to see the first wave of Ascension take place.

Permaculture allows that in natural systems, there is no waste; all resources can create benefit.At Jubilados, old age is seen not as an end point, but rather as a rededication to creative service as an expression of the spiritual connection. The community is in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The site provides a setting conducive to spiritual practice, and is close to medical, educational and recreational services. More important, the proximity affords the opportunity for meaningful service in many community settings. The Jubilados Community will create an integrated lifestyle, based on mutual support rather than dependence.  The physical plant will be constructed in traditional village design with clustered buildings, allowing for the greater part of the site to be dedicated to open space. Common areas will include a meditation hall, communal kitchen, dining facilities and administrative offices. There will also be a library, a theatre, a gym and studios.

Yet the influences around you at this time will encourage you to explore new options. Venus and Mercury in your opposite sign of Capricorn may mean that friends, loved ones, and anyone you are with on a regular basis will all try to encourage you to do things that they know will make you feel a whole lot better.

Take heart and wait it out -- peace will return in its own time. In the meanwhile, do not waste your precious life force worrying about something you cannot control. The Situation position refers to the general set of influences that surround you and affect your personal experience of peace. We all have to deal with conflict and are affected by the process.  When the Wheel of Fortune is in this position, your circumstances may be constantly fluctuating. The changes are driven by a force no mortal can control. Your immediate future is so uncertain. No one can blame you for feeling a bit overwhelmed or confused. Still, you need not succumb to despair. The force in operation is the great washing machine of life. If you can put up with the churning, the rinse cycle and the final spin, then the end result will leave you restored, like new.  As with the wheel, what appears up will soon be down and vice versa. In the end, everything will be resolved. It is still a challenge to keep your composure in mid-cycle, however, because the part of you that prefers control feels helpless. Wait and watch from a quiet, meditative place inside yourself, and as you do so, try to absorb and understand the process.

All this petty worry while the great cloak of the sky grows dark and intense round every living thing.  What is precious inside us does not care to be known by the mind in ways that diminish its presence.  What we strive for in perfection is not what turns us into the lit angel we desire,  what disturbs and then nourishes has everything we need.  What we hate in ourselves is what we cannot know in ourselves but what is true to the pattern does not need to be explained.  Inside everyone is a great shout of joy waiting to be born.  Even with the summer so far off I feel it grown in me now and ready to arrive in the world.  All those years listening to those who had nothing to say.  All those years forgetting how everything has its own voice to make itself heard.  All those years forgetting how easily you can belong to everything simply by listening.  And the slow difficulty of remembering how everything is born from an opposite and miraculous otherness. Silence and winter has led me to that otherness.  So let this winter of listening be enough for the new life I must call my own.~  David Whyte  urlLink \"This\" Excerpts - Poonjaji :  \"Before a wave rises it is Ocean, before desire moves it is Emptiness.

They can generate a variety of job possibilities, consider them for their ability to fulfill their values, and pursue them using their skills in communicating with others, either in writing or in person. Their idealism, commitment, flexibility and people skills will usually be communicated to others in the job search. Potential drawbacks for INFPs in the job search include unrealistic expectations for a job, feelings of inadequacy or lack of confidence, and inattention to details of the jobs or of the job search. Under stress, INFPs may become quite critical of others and themselves, and they may hold themselves back because they feel incompetent as they engage in this process. They can benefit from allowing their intuition to give them a new perspective on the possibilities available in the situation. They may also find it helpful to truly acknowledge their skills, as well as the importance of communicating those skills to others. In addition, INFPs can benefit from developing realistic expectations about the job search, and from objectively looking at the logical consequences of the various decisions they make. \"  urlLink Careers for INFP Personality Types :  Possible Career Paths for the INFP:  Writers  Counselors / Social Workers  Teachers / Professors  Psychologists  Psychiatrists  Musicians  Clergy / Religious Workers  urlLink ThinkHolistic.com - Knowledge Base : \"Isn\\'t the spiritual/religion route just a cop out? \"  urlLink www.mnftiu.cc | get your war on | page thirty-one : Great for a laugh.  urlLink Emode: Right Job, Wrong Job - Your Results : Heather, the Right Job for you will allow you to be:  Creative and AnalyticalYou\\'re a visionary in many people\\'s eyes - able to think outside of the box to come up with your own solutions.

The card in the Near Future position indicates which way the wind is blowing with regard to your situation. If you follow the Advice card, however, you can improve on or neutralize tendencies.With the Hierophant in this position, it appears that you may soon receive some acknowledgment, certification or approval from experts in your field. You are about to be recognized for your efforts, long term dedication and the passion it has taken to absorb the wisdom of those who came before you.In recognition of your dogged commitment, you are being brought into the inner circle. This is no accident. Trust the flow of events as they unfold. You may be needed to help with the transmission of sacred knowledge from the past into the future.General meaning  Traditionally known as the Hierophant, this card refers to a Master and the learning of practical lessons from the study of Natural Law. This energy of this card points to some agent or resource that can reveal the secrets of life, the cycles of the moon and tides, the links between human beings and the heavens.Because monasteries were the only places a person could learn to read and write in the middle ages, a Hierophant was one to whom a student would petition for entry. He was the one to set the curriculum for the neophyte\\'s course of study.Often pictured with the right hand raised in blessing, the Hierophant is linked with the ancient lineage of Melchezidek, initiator of the Hebrew priestly tradition, the one who passes on the teachings. All shamans of any tradition draw upon this archetype.  urlLink Department of Religion, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Florida : YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  urlLink Graduate Catalog - 2003-2004 - Fields of Instruction - ReligionurlLink PhD in Metaphysics : Why haven\\'t I thought of something like this before.

Our natures are one.  Without references to any strands of lineage, without refrences to texts or traditions, we drink the life-water together.\\'  Here\\'s a story about that hidden mystery:  The Chinese and the Greeks were arguing  as to who were the better artists.  The king said,\\'We\\'ll settle this matter with a debate.\\'  The Chinese began talking, but the Greeks wouldn\\'t say anything. They left.  The Chinese suggested then that they each be given  a room to work on with their artistry, two rooms facing each other and divided by a curtain.  The Chinese asked the king for a hundred colors, all the variations, and each morning they came to where the dyes were kept and took them all.  The Greeks took no colors.\\'They are not part of our work.\\' They went to their room and began cleaning and polishing the walls.  All day every day they made those walls as pure and clear as an open sky.  There is a way that leads from all-colors to colorlessness. Know that the magnificent variety  of the clouds and the weather comes from the total simplicity of the sun and the moon.  The Chinese finished, and they were so happy. They beat the drums in the joy of completion.  The king entered the room, astonished by the gorgeous color and detail.  The Greeks then pulled the curtain dividing the rooms. The Chinese figures and images shimmeringly reflected on the clear Greek walls. They lived there, even more beautifully, and always changing in the light.  The Greek art is the sufi way. They don\\'t study books of philosophical thought.  They make their loving clearer and clearer. No wantings, no anger. In that purity they receive and reflect the images of every moment, from here, from the stars, from the void.  They take them in as though they were seeing with the lighted clarity that sees them.  In your light I learn how to love. In your beauty, how to make poems.  You dance inside my chest, where no one sees you, but sometimes I do, and that sight becomes this art.  Drumsound rises on the air, its throb, my heart.  A voice inside that beats says,\"I know you are tired,but come. This is the way.\"  Are you jealous of the ocean\\'s generosity?

This factor, coupled with the increasing moonlight creates balanced root and leaf growth. This is the best time for planting above ground annual crops that produce their seeds outside the fruit. Examples are lettuce, spinach, celery, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and grain crops. Cucumbers like this phase also, even though they are an exception to that rule.  In the second quarter the gravitational pull is less, but the moonlight is strong, creating strong leaf growth. It is generally a good time for planting, especially two days before the full moon. The types of crops that prefer the second quarter are annuals that produce above ground, but their seeds form inside the fruit, such as beans, melons, peas, peppers, squash, and tomatoes. Mow lawns in the first or second quarter to increase growth.  After the full moon, as the moon wanes, the energy is drawing down. The gravitation pull is high, creating more moisture in the soil, but the moonlight is decreasing, putting energy into the roots. This is a favorable time for planting root crops, including beets, carrots, onions, potatoes, and peanuts. It is also good for perennials, biennials, bulbs and transplanting because of the active root growth. Pruning is best done in the third quarter, in the sign of Scorpio.  In the fourth quarter there is decreased gravitational pull and moonlight, and it is considered a resting period. This is also the best time to cultivate, harvest, transplant and prune. Mow lawns in the third or fourth quarter to retard growth.\"  urlLink More on gardening by the moon phases...urlLink HOSPICE of North Central Florida : Why do you want to be a Hospice volunteer?

Arden Dallas, TexasDear Arden: Being ticklish is a complicated trait rooted in our evolutionary past. Two searches, \\'physiology + ticklish\\' and \\'why are we ticklish,\\' turned up a number of articles that helped us understand this touchy, feely human feature.Scientists suggest that being ticklish is our defense against creepy crawlies like spiders and bugs, a physiological response alerting us to a specific type of threat. That is why vulnerable parts of our bodies -- feet, chest, and armpits, are among the most ticklish.While there is no question that being ticklish is neurological, scientists contend that it is also learned. One theory sees ticklishness as a personality-based response to perceived attack. Antsy folks may laugh uncontrollably at the lightest touch, or even without being touched at all, while folks made of sterner stuff won\\'t budge during more aggressive tickle attacks.If you close your eyes and try to remain calm while you are tickled, you can decrease panic, reduce giggles, and dull sensation. And, no matter how hard you try, it is nearly impossible to tickle yourself.Tickling satisfies our human need to touch. Robert R. Provine, a professor of neuroscience and author of Quest for Laughter, sees the tickle as a form of communication between friends, family, and lovers, playing a key role in the evolution of social and sexual behavior. He points to chimps tickling each other during play, parents tickling little kids, and lovers tickling each other affectionately.\\'If you think the social component is not important,\\' Provine says, \\'Try tickling a stranger.\\'  urlLink GRSL - Gainesville Regional Soccer LeagueurlLink myTrip Planner : Neat system which maps out places of interest.  urlLink NEAnnual EventsurlLink Gainesville Florida : Good links. BEGIN  This is now.  Now is, all there is.  Don\\'t wait for Then; strike the spark, light the fire.  Sit at the Beloved\\'s table, feast with gusto, drink your fill  then dance the way branches of jasmine and cypress dance in a spring wind.  The green earth is your cloth; tailor your robe with dignity and grace.  ~ Rumi  urlLink Osho Zen Tarot :  Friendliness  First meditate, be blissful, then much love will happen of its own accord. Then being with others is beautiful and being alone is also beautiful. Then it is simple, too. You don\\'t depend on others and you don\\'t make others dependent on you. Then it is always a friendship, a friendliness. It never becomes a relationship, it is always a relatedness. You relate, but you don\\'t create a marriage. Marriage is out of fear, relatedness is out of love. You relate; as long as things are moving beautifully, you share. And if you see that the moment has come to depart because your paths separate at this crossroad, you say good-bye with great gratitude for all that the other has been to you, for all the joys and all the pleasures and all the beautiful moments that you have shared with the other. With no misery, with no pain, you simply separate. - Osho The White Lotus Chapter 10  The branches of these two flowering trees are intertwined, and their fallen petals blend together on the ground in their beautiful colors. It is as if heaven and earth are bridged by love. But they stand individually, each rooted in the soil in their own connection with the earth. In this way they represent the essence of true friends, mature, easy with each other, natural. There is no urgency about their connection, no neediness, no desire to change the other into something else. This card indicates a readiness to enter this quality of friendliness. In the passage, you may notice that you are no longer interested in all kinds of dramas and romances that other people are engaged in. It is not a loss. It is the birth of a higher, more loving quality born of the fullness of experience. It is the birth of a love that is truly unconditional, without expectations or demands.  urlLink Stuff I Want To DourlLink BCGP - Broward County Green Party : I think I did my last update this morning.

Three baby bison were born in five days, culminating in the birth of Sunrise Spirit, a full-white female Saturday. Two other bison, both reddish brown, were born earlier in the month. One male, Wind Dancer, was born during such strong winds that he could barely stand.The birth of a white buffalo is very meaningful to many Native Americans, who hold that white buffalo are sacred and will return during a period of disaster in the world. Plains Lakota lore says the birth of a female white buffalo heralds a time of enlightenment and healing, bringing all races together in peace, balance and harmony.\"  urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : Moment To Moment The past is no more and the future is not yet: both are unnecessarily moving in directions which don\\'t exist. One used to exist, but no longer exists, and one has not even started to exist. The only right person is one who lives moment to moment, whose arrow is directed to the moment, who is always here and now; wherever he is, his whole consciousness, his whole being, is involved in the reality of here and in the reality of now. That\\'s the only right direction. Only such a man can enter into the golden gate. The present is the golden gate. Here-now is the golden gate. ...And you can be in the present only if you are not ambitious--no accomplishment, no desire to achieve power, money, prestige, even enlightenment, because all ambition leads you into the future. Only a non-ambitious man can remain in the present. A man who wants to be in the present has not to think, has just to see and enter the gate. Experience will come, but experience has not to be premeditated. Osho The Great Zen Master Ta Hui Chapter 37  Commentary:  As this figure moves across the stones, he steps lightly and non-seriously, and at the same time absolutely balanced and alert. Behind the swirling, ever-changing waters we can see the shapes of buildings; there appears to be a city in the background. The man is in the marketplace but at the same time outside of it, maintaining his balance and able to watch it from above. This card challenges us to move away from our preoccupations with other spaces and other times, and stay alert to what is happening in the here and now. Life is a great ocean in which you can play if you drop all your judgments, your preferences and the attachment to the details of your long-term plans.

We feel the need to initiate action, to act on new feelings, to tackle a new project and in general, to jump in to circumstances before we know the consequences. Additionally, the Moon in Aries forms a tense square with Mars in Cancer, making us struggle with the question of action versus inaction. We feel ready to express our feelings, yet we tend to hold something back, as if our survival depended on it.The Seven Of Pentacles -- Marge Piercy  Under a sky the color of pea soup she is looking at her work growing away there actively, thickly like grapevines or pole beans as things grow in the real world, slowly enough. If you tend them properly, if you mulch, if you water, if you provide birds that eat insects a home and winter food, if the sun shines and you pick off caterpillars, if the praying mantis comes and the ladybugs and the bees, then the plants flourish, but at their own internal clock.  Connections are made slowly, sometimes they grow underground. You cannot tell always by looking what is happening. More than half the tree is spread out in the soil under your feet. Penetrate quietly as the earthworm that blows no trumpet. Fight persistently as the creeper that brings down the tree. Spread like the squash plant that overruns the garden. Gnaw in the dark and use the sun to make sugar.  Weave real connections, create real nodes, build real houses. Live a life you can endure: Make love that is loving. Keep tangling and interweaving and taking more in, a thicket and bramble wilderness to the outside but to us interconnected with rabbit runs and burrows and lairs.  Live as if you liked yourself, and it may happen: reach out, keep reaching out, keep bringing in. This is how we are going to live for a long time: not always, for every gardener knows that after the digging, after the planting, after the long season of tending and growth, the harvest comes.  ~ Marge PiercyI tried taking some magnesium for my annoying  eye twitch  and it has really seemed to help.

It is quite visable and extremely annoying. Any answers would be appreciated. Thanks.  Answer: Twitching of the eye almost always occurs in the muscles of the eyelid. Because they press on the eye it may feel as though the eyeball itself is moving Minor eyelid twitches require no treatment as they usually resolve spontaneously. Reducing stress, using warm soaks, in some cases it occurs because of irritation in the eye, which results in twitching of the eyelid. However, if the eye is comfortable it is more likely that it is a simple muscle spasm, which may be related to stress or fatigue or in, many cases happen spontaneously without any known cause. Eye Twitching should resolve on its own it does not it certainly is worth a comprehensive eye examination to ensure that no other problem is occurring in the eye.

Photographs of the abuse were broadcast on U.S. television; one image depicted a hooded prisoner standing on a box with wires attached to his genitals. Other photos showed prisoners masturbating; several showed U.S. soldiers smiling and posing next to their victims. Some of the soldiers blamed mercenaries for the abuses; others said that military intelligence was in control of that cellblock. Photographs were published of British troops beating an Iraqi man and urinating on him; the pictures also showed a soldier striking the man in the genitals with a rifle; the victim\\'s jaw was reportedly broken and his teeth were smashed before he was thrown off the back of a moving truck. President Bush condemned the abuse. \"Their treatment does not reflect the nature of the American people,\" he said. \"That\\'s not the way we do things in America.\"The Urban Institute released a study showing that in some U.S. counties 30 percent of the population is in prison, and an abortion provider in Kansas City was accused of practicing fetal cannibalism. The United States used F-15E and F-16 warplanes, F-14 and F-18 fighter-bombers, AC-130 gunships, and AH-1W Super Cobra helicopters to bomb Fallujah. British Tornados were also used. Some three dozen laser-guided 500-pound bombs were dropped, and at least one building was blown up by accident. A Cobra helicopter fired a missile at a mosque and knocked over its minaret. U.S. forces, fearing a public relations disaster, pulled back from the city and left a new Iraqi force in charge under the command of General Jasim Muhammad Saleh, who served in the Republican Guard under Saddam Hussein. There was some confusion among American officials, however, as to whether the general was really in charge and whether he had actually served in the Republican Guard.

I can\\'t replace or reface them right now, and they\\'re just too dark for the room. I\\'d appreciate any tips.\" - Lyndee, via e-mail  John says: If you\\'re looking at ugly laminate, refacing it with not-so-ugly laminate is the best course of action, from the standpoint of durability and ease of care. But if it\\'s paint you want, the answer to your question is yes, as long as the laminate is well-adhered and in good condition. First, I\\'d wipe down all the surfaces with a solvent such as xylol to get rid of dirt and grease. Be sure to don chemical-resistant gloves, wear a respirator, shut off any pilot lights, and kick out the dog - this is powerful stuff. Then scuff up all the surfaces with 150-grit sandpaper and wipe them down again with xylol. Next, you want a primer that will adhere tenaciously and serve as a good base for paint. The one I use comes from X-I-M, a company that manufactures bonding primers; they have several solvent-based products suitable for your application. I find that the spray-applied primer actually holds better than the brush-on version. Allow two or three days for the primer to cure before sanding it lightly with 220-grit paper. Then you can apply either a latex or oil-based paint; I prefer oil in kitchens because it gives a smoother finish and is easier to clean.

Hundreds, pondering what to call themselves, daily besiege a small office in the centre of their capital where identity documents are issued. Held back by armed guards outside, some opt for surnames like Seven Drunk Men that hint at Mongolia\\'s national pastime.Others prefer to adopt the name of Genghis Khan, still the mightiest of Mongols, who now has 500 namesakes in Ulan Bator.When communism crumbled in 1990 the ban on family names was lifted but many nomadic herders who roam between Siberia and the Gobi desert continue to refer to each other only by single names.Now, to fight incest and make official records more intelligible, the Government has set a deadline of June 27 for all 2.5 million Mongolians to choose a family name on pain of a fine equivalent to several months\\' salary.\"We are returning to our ancient traditions,\" the Defence Minister said.

He decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal he asked for a drink of water. She thought he looked hungry so brought him a large glass of milk.He drank it slowly, and then asked, \"How much do I owe  you?\"  \"You don\\'t owe me anything,\" she replied. \"Mother has taught us never to accept pay for a kindness.\"  He said..... \"Then I thank you from my heart.\"  As Howard Kelly left that house, he not only felt stronger physically, but his faith in God and man was strong also. He had been ready to give up and quit. Many years later that same young woman became critically ill. The local doctors were baffled. They finally sent her to the big city, where they called in specialists to study her rare disease.  Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation. When he heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes.  Immediately he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. Dressed in his doctor\\'s gown he went in to see her. He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room determined to do his  best to save her life. From that day he gave special attention to her case. After a long struggle, the battle was won. Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent to her room. She feared  to open it, for she was sure it would take the rest of her life to pay for  it all. Finally she looked, and something caught her attention on the side  of the bill. She read these words.....\"Paid in full with one glass of milk\"  (Signed) Dr. Howard Kelly Tears of joy flooded her eyes as her happy heart prayed: \"Thank You, God, that Your love has spread abroad through human hearts and hands.\"There\\'s a saying which goes something like this: Bread cast on the waters comes back to you.

Research shows that the chemical that has addicted millions to smoking has a powerful impact on brain activity in patients who suffer from psychiatric and degenerative disorders.Some experiments have shown that nicotine can slow down the onset of Parkinson\\'s symptoms; others have had revealed its power in curtailing the hallucinations of schizophrenics.\\'A whole range of psychiatric conditions seem to be helped by nicotine,\\' said Dr Dan McGehee, a neurobiologist at the University of Chicago. \\'However, such benefits do not justify smoking. The lethal effects of cigarettes far outweigh any help they provide. On the other hand, our research does suggest that derivatives of nicotine, administered medically, could help to alleviate a range of psychiatric problems.\\'Nicotine is known to switch on receptors on the surface of cells in certain parts of the brain, causing these neurones to release the neuro-transmitter dopamine, a chemical that is associated with feelings of pleasure. This effect leads to a person\\'s addiction.More than 50 per cent of people suffering from clinical depression smoke, while the figure rises to 95 per cent for schizophrenics. But smoking among the general public has dropped to about 25 per cent. \\'The assumption is that people with psychiatric conditions are self-medicating,\\' said McGehee. \\'They are smoking because the nicotine in particularly helpful in alleviating their condition.\\'This point is backed by Dr Tony George, of Yale University. \\'Smoking is a marker for psychopathology,\\' he states in the current issue of the journal Nature Medicine.Similarly, it has been found that nicotine can sometimes slow the debilitating symptoms of Parkinson\\'s, a disease caused by the slow destruction of certain types of brain cells.\\'Either nicotine stimulates other types of brain cells to compensate for the loss of the cells involved in Parkinson\\'s, or it is somehow providing protection to remaining healthy Parkinson\\'s cells,\\' said McGehee. \\'Either way, the effect is noticeable.\\'  urlLink Dean Jones : Now some right wing nut... heather -  here is a citation to the salon article about dean and nader. if you don\\'t have salon premium then you might want to see if there is a link via the main NPR site, since they hosted it. had a blast hanging out with you last night. look forward to seeing you soon.  love, danielurlLink http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=3262027 PrayerWhatever happens.

Customer: Yes I have, but there are several programs running right now. Is it okay to install while they are running?  CS Rep: What programs are running ma\\'am?  Customer: Let me see....I have PASTHURT.EXE, LOWESTEEM.EXE, GRUDGE.EXE,and RESENTMENT.COM running right now.  CS Rep: No problem. LOVE will automatically erase PASTHURT.EXE from your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt other programs. LOVE will eventually overwrite LOWESTEEM.EXE with a module of its own called HIGHESTEEM.EXE. However, you have to completely turn off GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.COM. Those programs prevent LOVE from being properly installed. Can you turn those off ma\\'am?  Customer: I don\\'t know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how?  CS Rep: My pleasure. Go to your Start menu and invoke FORGIVENESS.EXE. Do this as many times as necessary until GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.COM have been completely erased.  Customer: Okay, I\\'m done. LOVE has started installing itself automatically. Is that normal?  CS Rep: Yes it is. You should receive a message that says it will reinstall for the life of your HEART. Do you see that message?  Customer: Yes I do. Is it completely installed?  CS Rep: Yes, but remember that you have only the base program. You need to begin connecting to other HEARTS in order to get the upgrades.  Customer: Oops...I have an error message already. What should I do?  CS Rep: What does the message say?  Customer: It says \"ERROR 412 - PROGRAM NOT RUN ON INTERNAL COMPONENTS.\" What does that mean?  CS Rep: Don\\'t worry ma\\'am, that\\'s a common problem. It means that the LOVE program is set up to run on external HEARTS but has not yet been run on your HEART. It is one of those complicated programming things, but in nontechnical terms it means you have to \"LOVE\" your own machine before it can \"LOVE\" others.  Customer: So what should I do?  CS Rep: Can you find the directory called \"SELF-ACCEPTANCE\"?  Customer: Yes, I have it.  CS Rep: Excellent, you are getting good at this.  Customer: Thank you.  CS Rep: You\\'re welcome. Click on the following files and then copy them to the \"MYHEART\" directory: FORGIVESELF.DOC, SELFESTEEM.TXT, REALIZEWORTH.TXT, and GOODNESS.DOC. The system will overwrite any conflicting files and begin patching any faulty programming. Also, you need to delete SELFCRITIC.EXE from all directories, and then empty your recycle bin afterwards to make sure it is completely gone and never comes back.  Customer: Got it. Hey! My HEART is filling up with really neat files. SMILE.MPG is playing on my monitor right now and it shows that WARMTH.COM, PEACE.EXE, and CONTENTMENT.COM are copying themselves all over my HEART!  CS Rep: Then LOVE is installed and running. You should be able to handle it from here. One more thing before I go...  Customer: Yes?  CS Rep: LOVE is freeware.

Select the pieces of paper to be recycled. You can even mix different types to create your own unique paper.  2. Rip the paper into small bits, and place into the blender. (about half full). Fill the blender with warm water. Run the blender slowly at first then increase the speed until the pulp looks smooth and well blended. ( 30 -40 seconds) Check that no flakes of paper remain. If there are, blend longer.  3. The next step is to make a mold. The mold, in this case, is made simply by stretching fiberglass screen (plain old door and window screen) over a wooden frame and stapling it. It should be as tight as possible.  4. Fill the basin about half way with water. Add 3 blender loads of pulp. (the more pulp you add the thicker the finished paper will be) Stir the mixture.  5. Now is the time to add the liquid starch for sizing.(This is not necessary but if the paper is going to be used for writing on, you should add some, the starch helps to prevent inks from soaking into the paper fibers.) Stir 2 teaspoons of liquid starch into the pulp.  Place the mold into the pulp and then level it out while it is submerged. Gently wiggle it side-to-side until the pulp on top of the screen looks even.  6. Slowly lift the mold up until it is above the level of the water. Wait until most of the water has drained from the new paper sheet. If the paper is very thick, remove some pulp from the tub. If it is too thin, add more pulp and stir the mixture again.  7. When the mold stops dripping, gently place one edge on the side of a fabric square (felt or flannel square). Gently ease the mold down flat, with the paper directly on the fabric. Use a sponge to press out as much water as possible. Wring the excess water from the sponge back into the large plastic tub.  8. Now comes the tricky part. Hold the fabric square flat and slowly lift the edge of the mold. The wet sheet of paper should remain on the fabric. If it sticks to the mold, you may have pulled to fast or not pressed out enough water. It takes a little practice. You can gently press out any bubbles and loose edges at this point.  9. Repeat the steps above, and stack the fabric squares on a cookie sheet. Save one fabric square to place on the top of the stack to cover the last piece of paper. Use another cookie sheet to press the remaining water out of the stack. (do this outside or in the bathtub, it can make a mess)  10. After you press the stack, gently separate the sheets. They can be dried by hanging on a clothesline or laying them out on sheets of newspaper. When they have dried peel them off the fabric and voila! you have paper! 35 days, 15 hours, 16 minutes and 40 seconds  smoke free . 713 cigarettes not smoked.  $108.00 and 5 days, 10 hours of life saved.urlLink The Joys of Dryer Lint? :Dryer Lint Clay  3 cups lint  2 cups cold water  1 cup flour  3 drops oil of cloves or wintergreen flavoring (if you want scented clay)  newspaper  saucepan  paint, glue, glitter (or whatever else you might want to use to decorate your finished clay project)  In the saucepan, soak dryer lint in water.
